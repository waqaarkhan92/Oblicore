PLS Reference: docs/specs/80_AI_Extraction_Rules_Library.md Section 5.2

Key Principles:

1. **Module Registration:**
   - Add new module to `modules` table (see Section C.4 - Module Registry Table)
   - Set `module_code` (e.g., 'MODULE_4', 'MODULE_PACKAGING')
   - Set `module_name` (e.g., 'Packaging Regulations')
   - Configure `requires_module_id` if module has prerequisites
   - Set `pricing_model` and `base_price`
   - Define `document_types` JSONB array (which document types this module handles)

2. **Module-Specific Entities:**
   - Each module can define its own entities following the same pattern as Module 2/3
   - Example: Module 2 has Consent, Parameter, LabResult, Exceedance entities
   - Example: Module 3 has Generator, RunHourRecord, StackTest, MaintenanceRecord, AERDocument entities
   - New modules should follow the same entity definition pattern (see Sections B.13-B.22)

3. **Module-Specific Tables:**
   - Each module can define its own database tables
   - Tables should follow naming conventions (snake_case)
   - Tables should include standard fields: id, created_at, updated_at
   - Tables should reference `documents` table via `document_id` foreign key
   - See Sections C.2 (Module 2 Tables) and C.3 (Module 3 Tables) for examples

4. **Module-Specific Enums:**
   - Each module can define its own enums for module-specific statuses/types
   - Enums should follow naming conventions (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
   - See Sections D.2 (Module 2 Enums) and D.3 (Module 3 Enums) for examples

5. **Module-Specific Terms:**
   - Each module defines its own LLM vocabulary
   - Terms should be documented in module-specific terms section
   - See Sections J.1 (Module 1 Terms), J.2 (Module 2 Terms), J.3 (Module 3 Terms) for examples

6. **Module Routing:**
   - Module routing is determined by `modules.document_types` JSONB field
   - When a document is uploaded, system queries `modules` table to find which module handles that `document_type`
   - Module routing logic is dynamic (no code changes needed)

7. **Module Activation:**
   - Module activation is handled via `module_activations` table
   - Prerequisites are enforced via `modules.requires_module_id` foreign key
   - Activation logic queries `modules` table to determine prerequisites

8. **Module Pricing:**
   - Pricing is stored in `modules.base_price` and `modules.pricing_model`
   - Billing logic queries `modules` table to calculate charges
   - No code changes needed for new pricing models

Example: Adding Module 4 (Packaging Regulations)

1. **Register Module:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO modules (module_code, module_name, module_description, requires_module_id, pricing_model, base_price, is_active, is_default, document_types)
   VALUES (
     'MODULE_4',
     'Packaging Regulations',
     'Packaging waste compliance and PRN (Packaging Recovery Note) management',
     NULL,  -- No prerequisite
     'per_site',
     49.00,
     true,
     false,
     '["PACKAGING_REGISTRATION", "PRN_CERTIFICATE"]'::JSONB
   );
   ```

2. **Define Entities:**
   - Create Section B.32: PackagingRegistration
   - Create Section B.33: PRNCertificate
   - Follow same pattern as B.13-B.22

3. **Define Tables:**
   - Create Section C.5: Module 4 Tables (Packaging) - Note: C.4 is reserved for Module Registry Table
   - Define `packaging_registrations` table
   - Define `prn_certificates` table
   - Follow same pattern as C.2 and C.3

4. **Define Enums:**
   - Create Section D.4: Module 4 Enums (Packaging)
   - Define packaging-specific enums
   - Follow same pattern as D.2 and D.3

5. **Define Terms:**
   - Create Section J.4: Module 4 Terms (Packaging)
   - Document packaging-specific LLM vocabulary
   - Follow same pattern as J.1, J.2, J.3

6. **Add Extraction Rules:**
   - Add Module 4 patterns to AI Extraction Rules Library
   - Patterns reference module via `module_id` (UUID) or `module_code` in JSON
   - See AI Extraction Rules Library Section 3 for pattern examples

7. **Add Workflows:**
   - Document Module 4 workflows in User Workflow Maps
   - Follow same pattern as Module 2/3 workflows

**Benefits of This Pattern:**
- ✅ New modules can be added without database schema migrations (except for module-specific tables)
- ✅ Module configuration is data-driven (stored in `modules` table)
- ✅ Prerequisites are enforced via foreign keys (no hardcoded logic)
- ✅ Pricing is configurable per module (no code changes)
- ✅ Module routing is dynamic (based on `document_types` in `modules` table)
- ✅ Consistent pattern across all modules (easier to maintain)

**Note:** Module-specific tables (Module 2 and Module 3) follow a consistent pattern. To add Module 4 (Packaging) or any future module, create new tables following the same pattern. See Section B.31 (Module Extension Pattern) for detailed guidance on adding new modules. Module-specific tables are registered via the `modules` table (see Section C.4 - Module Registry Table), and module routing is determined dynamically based on `modules.document_types`.



C.4 Module Registry Table

Table: modules

Purpose: Registry of all available modules (replaces hardcoded module_type enum). This table enables dynamic module addition without database schema changes.

Entity: Module

PLS Reference: Section A.1.3 (Module Activation Rules), Section D.1 (Module Prerequisites)

Fields:

Field Name	Type	Constraints	Nullable	Default	Description

id	UUID	PRIMARY KEY	NO	gen_random_uuid()	Unique identifier

module_code	TEXT	NOT NULL, UNIQUE	NO	-	Module code (e.g., 'MODULE_1', 'MODULE_4', 'MODULE_PACKAGING')

module_name	TEXT	NOT NULL	NO	-	Human-readable module name (e.g., 'Environmental Permits', 'Packaging Regulations')

module_description	TEXT	-	YES	NULL	Module description and purpose

requires_module_id	UUID	FOREIGN KEY	YES	NULL	Prerequisite module (references modules.id). NULL = no prerequisite.

pricing_model	TEXT	NOT NULL, CHECK	NO	-	Pricing model: 'per_site', 'per_company', 'per_document'

base_price	DECIMAL(10, 2)	NOT NULL	NO	0.00	Base price in GBP per billing period

is_active	BOOLEAN	NOT NULL	NO	true	Whether module is available for activation

is_default	BOOLEAN	NOT NULL	NO	false	Whether module is activated by default on signup (typically Module 1 only)

document_types	JSONB	-	YES	NULL	Array of document types this module handles (e.g., ["ENVIRONMENTAL_PERMIT"])

cross_sell_keywords	TEXT[]	-	NO	'{}'	Keywords that trigger cross-sell prompts for this module

workflow_config	JSONB	-	YES	NULL	Module-specific workflow configuration (optional)

created_at	TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE	NOT NULL	NO	NOW()	Record creation timestamp

updated_at	TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE	NOT NULL	NO	NOW()	Last update timestamp

Indexes:

* idx_modules_module_code: module_code (for lookups by code)

* idx_modules_is_active: is_active (for filtering active modules)

* idx_modules_requires_module_id: requires_module_id (for prerequisite queries)

* idx_modules_is_default: is_default (for finding default module)

Foreign Keys:

* requires_module_id → modules.id ON DELETE RESTRICT (prevent deletion of prerequisite)

RLS Enabled: Yes

Soft Delete: No

Notes:

* This table replaces the hardcoded `module_type` enum. All modules (current and future) are registered here.

* To add a new module (e.g., Module 4 - Packaging), insert a new row with appropriate module_code, module_name, and configuration.

* Prerequisites are enforced via `requires_module_id` foreign key. Activation logic queries this table to determine prerequisites.

* Pricing is stored in `base_price` and `pricing_model`. Billing logic queries this table to calculate charges.

* Document types are stored in `document_types` JSONB array. Module routing logic uses this to determine which module handles which document type.

Example Data:

```sql
-- Module 1 (Environmental Permits) - Default module
INSERT INTO modules (module_code, module_name, module_description, requires_module_id, pricing_model, base_price, is_active, is_default, document_types)

  NULL,
  'per_site',
  149.00,

  true,
  '["ENVIRONMENTAL_PERMIT"]'::JSONB
);

-- Module 2 (Trade Effluent) - Requires Module 1

  'per_site',
  59.00,
  true,
  false,
  '["TRADE_EFFLUENT_CONSENT"]'::JSONB
);

-- Module 3 (MCPD/Generators) - Requires Module 1

**Blocking State Naming Convention:**
- **`is_blocking` (review_queue_items table):** Boolean flag indicating whether a review queue item blocks document activation/progress. When `is_blocking = true`, the document cannot be activated until the review item is resolved.
- **"Block Activation" (module activation logic):** Separate concept referring to module activation being blocked due to missing prerequisites (via `modules.requires_module_id`). This is not stored as a boolean field but enforced via business logic in activation workflows.
- **Relationship:** Both concepts prevent progress, but operate at different levels:
  - `is_blocking` = Review-level blocking (blocks document activation)
  - "Block Activation" = Module-level blocking (blocks module activation)
- **See Also:** PLS Section D.1.1 (Module Activation Rules), PLS Section B.1.3 (Review Queue Logic)

D. ENUMS AND STATUS VALUES

D.1 Core System Enums

Enum: obligation_category

Type: TEXT with CHECK constraint

Used In: obligations.category

Values:

* `MONITORING`: Measuring, sampling, testing activities (e.g., pH testing, emissions monitoring, noise surveys). Default frequency: Daily/Weekly/Monthly

* `REPORTING`: Submitting data/reports to regulators (e.g., annual returns, exceedance notifications, AERs). Default frequency: Annual/Quarterly/Event-triggered

* `RECORD_KEEPING`: Maintaining logs and documentation (e.g., waste transfer notes, maintenance logs, training records). Default frequency: Ongoing/As-generated

* `OPERATIONAL`: Day-to-day operational requirements (e.g., operating hours, material handling, containment). Default frequency: Continuous/Ongoing

* `MAINTENANCE`: Equipment servicing and upkeep (e.g., stack testing, equipment calibration, repair records). Default frequency: Annual/6-monthly/Scheduled

State Transitions:

* All values are valid initial states

* User can change category at any time (override logged)

* Default if uncertain: RECORD_KEEPING (lowest consequence for miscategorisation)

PLS Reference: Section A.2 (Obligation Categories)



Enum: obligation_status

Type: TEXT with CHECK constraint

Used In: obligations.status

Values:

* `PENDING`: Obligation created but not yet due; no action required

* `IN_PROGRESS`: User has started working on this obligation (evidence upload in progress)

* `COMPLETED`: Obligation satisfied with evidence linked within compliance period

* `OVERDUE`: Deadline has passed without evidence or completion

* `INCOMPLETE`: Compliance period ended but no evidence linked for that period (evidence expected but not found)

* `LATE_COMPLETE`: Evidence linked after deadline date (compliance achieved but late)

* `NOT_APPLICABLE`: Obligation marked as N/A by user with reason provided

* `REJECTED`: Obligation rejected during review (extraction error or invalid)

State Transitions:

* Initial state: PENDING

* PENDING → IN_PROGRESS (user action)

* PENDING → OVERDUE (deadline passed)

* IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED (evidence linked)

* IN_PROGRESS → OVERDUE (deadline passed)

* OVERDUE → INCOMPLETE (compliance period ended, no evidence)

* OVERDUE → LATE_COMPLETE (evidence linked post-deadline)

* OVERDUE → NOT_APPLICABLE (user marks N/A)

* INCOMPLETE → LATE_COMPLETE (evidence linked retroactively)

* Any state → REJECTED (review rejection)

* REJECTED → PENDING (if re-activated)

**Relationship to deadline_status:**
- When `obligation_status = IN_PROGRESS`, the associated `deadline.status` remains `PENDING` or `DUE_SOON` (deadline status does not have an `IN_PROGRESS` value)
- When `obligation_status = COMPLETED`, the associated `deadline.status` should be `COMPLETED`
- When `obligation_status = OVERDUE`, the associated `deadline.status` should be `OVERDUE`
- When `obligation_status = REJECTED`, the associated `deadline.status` remains unchanged (deadline status does not have a `REJECTED` value)

* `ANNUAL`: Once per year (1 deadline/year)

* `ONE_TIME`: Single occurrence (1 deadline total)

* `CONTINUOUS`: Ongoing/constant requirement (no scheduled deadlines; status-based)

* `EVENT_TRIGGERED`: On specific event (deadline created when event occurs)

State Transitions:

* All values are valid initial states

* User can modify frequency (changes future deadlines)

* ONE_TIME cannot transition to recurring frequencies

* CONTINUOUS cannot have scheduled deadlines

PLS Reference: Section F.1 (Frequency Types), Section C.1.5 (Monitoring Frequency Logic)



Enum: document_type

Type: TEXT with CHECK constraint

* `MCPD_REGISTRATION`: MCPD Registration or Specified Generator Registration

**Note:** New modules can add new document types. For example, Module 4 (Packaging) might add `PACKAGING_REGISTRATION` and `PRN_CERTIFICATE`. Document types are associated with modules via the `modules.document_types` JSONB field. Module routing logic queries the `modules` table to determine which module handles which document type. See Section B.31 (Module Extension Pattern) for guidance on adding new modules and their document types.

State Transitions:

* Set at document upload (cannot change after extraction)

* Determines module routing and extraction rules

* Module routing is dynamic (based on `modules.document_types` JSONB field)

- Prerequisites are enforced via `modules.requires_module_id` foreign key
- Pricing is stored in `modules.base_price` and `modules.pricing_model`
- Module configuration is stored in `modules` table (document types, cross-sell keywords, etc.)

**See:** Section C.4 (Module Registry Table) for the `modules` table definition. For business logic on module extension, see Product Logic Specification Section C.4 (Module Extension Pattern).

D.10 Pack Enums (v1.0 — All Pack Types)

> [v1 UPDATE – Pack Type Enum – 2024-12-27]

Enum: pack_type

Type: TEXT with CHECK constraint

Used In: audit_packs.pack_type

Values:

**v1.0 Commercial Pack Types:**
* `AUDIT_PACK`: Full evidence compilation for internal audits (all plans)
* `REGULATOR_INSPECTION`: Inspector-ready compliance pack (Core plan, included)
* `TENDER_CLIENT_ASSURANCE`: Compliance summary for tenders (Growth plan)
* `BOARD_MULTI_SITE_RISK`: Multi-site risk summary (Growth plan)
* `INSURER_BROKER`: Risk narrative for insurance (requires Growth Plan, same as Tender Pack — independent pack type)

**Legacy Module-Specific Pack Types (deprecated in v1.0):**
* `COMBINED`: All active modules combined (deprecated - use AUDIT_PACK)
* `MODULE_1`: Module 1 specific pack (deprecated - use AUDIT_PACK or REGULATOR_INSPECTION)
* `MODULE_2`: Module 2 specific pack (deprecated - use AUDIT_PACK)
* `MODULE_3`: Module 3 specific pack (deprecated - use AUDIT_PACK)

**v1.0 Pack Type Migration Strategy:**

**Backward Compatibility Rules:**
1. **Reading Legacy Packs:**
   - ✅ System CAN read legacy packs (COMBINED, MODULE_1, MODULE_2, MODULE_3)
   - Legacy packs display with "(Legacy)" badge in UI
   - All pack viewing/download features work normally for legacy packs
   - Legacy packs remain queryable in database

2. **Creating New Packs:**
   - ❌ System CANNOT create new packs with legacy types
   - API rejects legacy pack types with 400 error: "Pack type {type} is deprecated. Please use: AUDIT_PACK, REGULATOR_INSPECTION, TENDER_CLIENT_ASSURANCE, BOARD_MULTI_SITE_RISK, or INSURER_BROKER"
   - Frontend UI only shows v1.0 pack types in dropdown
   - Validation enforced at application layer (API + frontend)

3. **Migration Behavior:**
   - NO automatic migration of legacy packs
   - Legacy packs preserved as-is (historical record, audit trail)
   - Users can regenerate pack with v1.0 type if needed
   - Old packs remain immutable (read-only)

4. **Database Constraints:**
   - CHECK constraint allows legacy types for backward compatibility: `pack_type IN ('REGULATOR_INSPECTION', 'TENDER_CLIENT_ASSURANCE', 'BOARD_MULTI_SITE_RISK', 'INSURER_BROKER', 'AUDIT_PACK', 'COMBINED', 'MODULE_1', 'MODULE_2', 'MODULE_3')`
   - Application layer validates: new packs must use v1.0 types only
   - No CASCADE updates to legacy packs

5. **Module Code vs Pack Type Clarification:**
   - `module_code` (MODULE_1, MODULE_2, MODULE_3) in `modules` table - STILL VALID (refers to active modules)
   - `pack_type` (MODULE_1, MODULE_2, MODULE_3) in `audit_packs` table - DEPRECATED (refers to legacy pack format)
   - These are DIFFERENT enums despite same names (historical artifact)
   - Going forward: modules use module_code, packs use v1.0 pack_type

**Migration Recommendations:**
- For customers with legacy packs: Leave as-is for historical reference
- For new pack generation: Always use v1.0 pack types
- For reporting: Query includes legacy packs but flags them appropriately
- For API clients: Update to use v1.0 pack types before January 2025

**Implementation Note:**
- v1.0 pack types are fixed enum values (not dynamic)
- Pack type determines content structure and access control
- Plan-based access: Core Plan can generate `REGULATOR_INSPECTION` and `AUDIT_PACK` only
- Growth Plan can generate all pack types
- Consultant Edition can generate all pack types for assigned clients
- Legacy module-specific pack types supported for READ ONLY (not creation)

**Pack Type Access Control:**
- Core Plan: `REGULATOR_INSPECTION`, `AUDIT_PACK`
- Growth Plan: All pack types
- Consultant Edition: All pack types (for assigned clients)

State Transitions:

* Set at generation (cannot change)

* Determines pack content and structure

* Plan-based access enforced at generation time

**Note:** 
- `audit_packs.distribution_method` can be `DOWNLOAD`, `EMAIL`, or `SHARED_LINK`
- `pack_distributions.distribution_method` can only be `EMAIL` or `SHARED_LINK` (downloads are not tracked as distributions)

State Transitions:

* Set at distribution (cannot change)

* Determines how pack was delivered to recipient

E. LLM VOCABULARY

This section defines ALL terms that the LLM must recognize during document extraction, obligation parsing, and system interactions. Each term maps to specific entities, tables, and fields in the system.

E.1 Module 1 Terms (Environmental Permits)

Term: Environmental Permit

Definition: A regulatory document issued by EA, SEPA, NRW, or NIEA that authorises specific activities and sets compliance obligations. The primary document type for Module 1.

Maps To:
- Entity: Document
- Table: documents
- Field(s): document_type = 'ENVIRONMENTAL_PERMIT', module_id (set by routing query: SELECT id FROM modules WHERE document_types @> '["ENVIRONMENTAL_PERMIT"]'::JSONB)

Context: Used during document upload and module routing. LLM must identify this term to route document to appropriate module. Routing is dynamic: system queries modules table WHERE document_types @> '["ENVIRONMENTAL_PERMIT"]'::JSONB to find matching module, then sets documents.module_id to the returned UUID. No hardcoded module_code checks.

Examples:
- "Environmental Permit EP123456"
- "This Environmental Permit authorises..."
- "Permit reference: EP/12345/AB"

PLS Reference: Section C.1.1 (Supported Document Types - Module 1)



Term: Part A Permit

Definition: A type of Environmental Permit for larger, more complex installations (Part A activities). Regulated by EA in England.

Maps To:
- Entity: Document
- Table: documents
- Field(s): document_type = 'ENVIRONMENTAL_PERMIT', metadata.permitsubtype = 'PART_A'

Context: Used to identify permit complexity and determine extraction patterns. Part A permits typically have more obligations than Part B.

Examples:
- "Part A Environmental Permit"
- "Part A(1) Installation"
- "Part A Permit EP123456"

PLS Reference: Section C.1.1 (Supported Document Types - Module 1)



Term: Part B Permit

Definition: A type of Environmental Permit for smaller installations (Part B activities). Regulated by EA or Local Authorities in England.

Maps To:
- Entity: Document
- Table: documents
- Field(s): document_type = 'ENVIRONMENTAL_PERMIT', metadata.permitsubtype = 'PART_B'

Context: Used to identify permit type. Part B permits typically have fewer obligations than Part A.

Examples:
- "Part B Environmental Permit"
- "Part B(2) Installation"
- "Local Authority Part B Permit"

PLS Reference: Section C.1.1 (Supported Document Types - Module 1)



Term: Waste Management Licence (WML)

Definition: A type of Environmental Permit for waste management activities. Also known as WML.

Maps To:
- Entity: Document
- Table: documents
- Field(s): document_type = 'ENVIRONMENTAL_PERMIT', metadata.permitsubtype = 'WML'

Context: Used to identify waste-specific permits. May have different obligation patterns than standard permits.

Examples:
- "Waste Management Licence"
- "WML EP123456"
- "Waste Management Licence Number: EP/12345/WM"

PLS Reference: Section C.1.1 (Supported Document Types - Module 1)



Term: PPC Permit

Definition: Pollution Prevention and Control Permit issued by SEPA in Scotland. Equivalent to Environmental Permit in England.

Maps To:

Context: Used to identify Scottish permits. May use different terminology than EA permits.

Examples:
- "PPC Permit"
- "PPC Permit Number: PPC/12345"
- "Pollution Prevention and Control Permit"

PLS Reference: Section C.1.1 (Supported Document Types - Module 1)



Term: Standard Condition

Definition: Boilerplate conditions present on most permits. These are pre-defined in the rule library for pattern matching.

Maps To:
- Entity: Obligation
- Table: obligations
- Field(s): category, frequency (from rule library match)

Context: LLM should first check rule library for standard conditions before extracting. If match found (≥90% confidence), use library template.

Examples:
- "Condition 2.1: The operator shall operate in accordance with a management system"
- "Standard Condition Schedule 1"
- "Standard conditions apply as set out in..."

PLS Reference: Section A.3.1 (Condition Type Definitions), Section B.2.2 (Rule Library Lookup)



Term: Site-Specific Condition

Definition: Custom conditions unique to the permitted activity. Not found in standard conditions library.

Maps To:
- Entity: Obligation
- Table: obligations
- Field(s): All fields extracted via LLM, review_status = 'PENDING' (always flagged)

Context: LLM must perform full extraction for site-specific conditions. Always flagged for human review.

F. AI INTERPRETATION RULES

This section defines exact meanings for AI-related concepts used in document extraction, obligation parsing, and compliance tracking. These definitions ensure consistent interpretation across the system.

F.1 Subjective Obligation

Definition: An obligation containing language that requires human interpretation. The system cannot determine compliance automatically because the language lacks objective, measurable criteria.

Criteria: An obligation is classified as subjective if it contains one or more subjective phrases from the detection list, OR if it contains context-dependent phrases without qualifying criteria.

Detection Method:
1. Text normalised (lowercase, whitespace normalised)
2. Exact match check against subjective phrase list
3. Fuzzy match check against context-dependent patterns
4. If match found: `is_subjective = true`
5. Store matched phrases in `subjective_phrases` array

Always Flag Phrases (100% confidence):
- "as appropriate"
- "where necessary"
- "where practicable"
- "reasonable measures"
- "adequate steps"
- "as soon as practicable"
- "to the satisfaction of"
- "unless otherwise agreed"
- "appropriate measures"
- "suitable provision"
- "best endeavours"
- "reasonably practicable"

Context-Dependent Phrases (LLM evaluates context):
- "regularly" (flag if no frequency specified)
- "maintained" (flag if no criteria specified)
- "adequate" (flag if no standard referenced)
- "prevent" (flag if success criteria unclear)

Examples:
- Example 1: "The operator shall take appropriate measures to prevent odour" → Subjective (contains "appropriate measures" and "prevent" without success criteria)
- Example 2: "Monitor pH weekly" → Objective (clear frequency and parameter)
- Example 3: "Maintain records as appropriate" → Subjective (contains "as appropriate")

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.is_subjective (BOOLEAN)
- Field: obligations.subjective_phrases (TEXT[])
- Field: obligations.interpretation_notes (TEXT)
- Enum: N/A (boolean flag)

System Behavior:
- Obligation displayed with "Requires Interpretation" badge
- User MUST add interpretation notes before marking complete
- Interpretation notes stored and included in audit pack
- Flag cannot be removed by user (system-determined)
- System prompts: "How will you demonstrate compliance with this obligation?"

PLS Reference: Section A.6 (Subjective Obligation Flags), Section E.3 (Subjective Language Detection)



F.2 Objective Obligation

Definition: An obligation with clear, measurable requirements that the system can track automatically. Contains specific parameters, frequencies, deadlines, or quantifiable criteria.

Criteria: An obligation is classified as objective if:
1. No subjective phrases detected in text
2. Contains measurable parameters (dates, frequencies, quantities, limits)
3. Success criteria are clear and verifiable
4. Compliance can be determined by evidence presence and deadline status

Examples:
- Example 1: "Monitor pH weekly and record results" → Objective (clear frequency: weekly, clear parameter: pH, clear action: record)
- Example 2: "Submit annual return by 31 January each year" → Objective (clear deadline: 31 January, clear frequency: annual)
- Example 3: "Maintain noise levels below 45dB at boundary" → Objective (clear limit: 45dB, clear location: boundary)
- Example 4: "Keep records for 6 years" → Objective (clear duration: 6 years, clear action: keep records)

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.is_subjective = false (BOOLEAN)
- Field: obligations.frequency (TEXT enum)
- Field: obligations.deadline_date (DATE)
- Field: obligations.category (TEXT enum)

F.3 Confidence Score

Definition: A numeric value (0.00-1.00) representing the LLM's certainty in extraction accuracy. Higher scores indicate higher confidence that the extracted data is correct.

Calculation Formula:
```
Confidence Score = (Pattern Match × 0.4) + (Structure × 0.3) + (Semantic × 0.2) + (OCR × 0.1)
```

Component Breakdown:
1. **Pattern Match Score (40% weight):** How closely text matches known patterns in rule library
   - Range: 0-100%
   - Calculation: % match against rule library patterns
   - Rule library matches have higher baseline (≥90% = 0.95 baseline)

2. **Structural Clarity (30% weight):** Document formatting quality assessment
   - Range: 0-100%
   - Factors: Headers, numbering, section structure, table formatting
   - Well-structured documents score higher

3. **Semantic Coherence (20% weight):** Internal consistency of extracted data
   - Range: 0-100%
   - Factors: Field values are consistent with each other, dates are logical, frequencies match patterns

4. **OCR Quality (10% weight):** OCR confidence if scanned PDF, or 100% for native PDF
   - Range: 0-100%
   - Native PDF: 100%
   - Scanned PDF: OCR confidence score (if <80%, flags document for review)

Examples:
- Example 1: Pattern match 95%, Structure 90%, Semantic 85%, OCR 100% → Confidence = (0.95×0.4) + (0.90×0.3) + (0.85×0.2) + (1.00×0.1) = 0.92 (92%)
- Example 2: Pattern match 60%, Structure 70%, Semantic 65%, OCR 75% → Confidence = (0.60×0.4) + (0.70×0.3) + (0.65×0.2) + (0.75×0.1) = 0.66 (66%)
- Example 3: Pattern match 50%, Structure 40%, Semantic 45%, OCR 60% → Confidence = (0.50×0.4) + (0.40×0.3) + (0.45×0.2) + (0.60×0.1) = 0.47 (47%)

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.confidence_score (DECIMAL(5,4), range 0.0000-1.0000)

PLS Reference: Section A.5 (Confidence Scoring Rules), Section E.2 (Confidence Scoring Methodology)



F.4 High Confidence (≥85%)

Definition: Confidence score of 0.85 (85%) or higher. Indicates high certainty that extraction is accurate.

Threshold: confidence_score ≥ 0.85 (≥85%)

What It Means:
- LLM is highly certain extraction is correct
- Pattern matches are strong
- Document structure is clear
- Extracted data is internally consistent

What Happens:
- **Auto-accept:** Extraction automatically accepted
- **UI Treatment:** Extraction shown as "Confirmed" with green indicator
- **User Experience:** User can still edit if needed, but no blocking review required
- **Review Status:** review_status = 'CONFIRMED' (auto-confirmed)
- **Workflow:** Obligation moves directly to active obligations list
- **Review Queue:** Not added to review queue (unless other flags present)

Examples:
- Example 1: Confidence 0.92 (92%) → Auto-accepted, shown as "Confirmed", no review required
- Example 2: Confidence 0.87 (87%) → Auto-accepted, user can edit if desired
- Example 3: Confidence 0.85 (85%) → Auto-accepted (threshold boundary)

Edge Cases:
- If confidence ≥85% BUT subjective phrases detected → Still flagged for interpretation (non-blocking)
- If confidence ≥85% BUT date parsing failed → Still flagged for review (blocking)

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.confidence_score ≥ 0.85
- Field: obligations.review_status = 'CONFIRMED' (auto-set)
- Enum: confidence_level = 'HIGH' (calculated)

PLS Reference: Section A.5.2 (Confidence Thresholds), Section E.2.2 (Confidence Thresholds Application)



F.5 Medium Confidence (70-84%)

Definition: Confidence score between 0.70 (70%) and 0.84 (84%). Indicates moderate certainty with some uncertainty.

Threshold: 0.70 ≤ confidence_score < 0.85 (70-84%)

What It Means:
- LLM has moderate certainty but some uncertainty exists
- Pattern matches may be partial
- Document structure may have some issues
- Some extracted data may need verification

What Happens:
- **Flag for Review:** Extraction flagged for human review (non-blocking)
- **UI Treatment:** Yellow highlight with "Review recommended" label
- **User Experience:** User can proceed but review is recommended
- **Review Status:** review_status = 'PENDING' (flagged)
- **Workflow:** Obligation added to review queue with priority based on other factors
- **Review Queue:** Added to review queue, sorted by priority

Examples:
- Example 1: Confidence 0.78 (78%) → Flagged for review, yellow highlight, review recommended
- Example 2: Confidence 0.72 (72%) → Flagged for review, user can proceed but should verify
- Example 3: Confidence 0.84 (84%) → Flagged for review (threshold boundary)

User Actions:
- User can confirm extraction (review_status → 'CONFIRMED')
- User can edit extraction (review_status → 'EDITED')
- User can reject extraction (review_status → 'REJECTED')
- User can proceed without review (not recommended)

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.confidence_score (0.70-0.84)
- Field: obligations.review_status = 'PENDING'
- Field: review_queue_items.review_type = 'LOW_CONFIDENCE' (if <70% threshold)
- Enum: confidence_level = 'MEDIUM' (calculated)

PLS Reference: Section A.5.2 (Confidence Thresholds), Section E.2.2 (Confidence Thresholds Application)



F.6 Low Confidence (<70%)

Definition: Confidence score below 0.70 (70%). Indicates low certainty and high risk of extraction errors.

Threshold: confidence_score < 0.70 (<70%)

What It Means:
- LLM has low certainty in extraction accuracy
- Pattern matches are weak or non-existent
- Document structure may be poor
- Extracted data may be unreliable
- High risk of extraction errors

What Happens:
- **Require Review:** Extraction requires mandatory human review (blocking)
- **UI Treatment:** Red highlight with blocking indicator, cannot proceed without review
- **User Experience:** User MUST review before obligation can be activated
- **Review Status:** review_status = 'PENDING' (blocking)
- **Workflow:** Obligation blocked until human review completed
- **Review Queue:** Added to review queue with HIGH priority, is_blocking = true

Examples:
- Example 1: Confidence 0.65 (65%) → Blocking review required, red flag, cannot proceed
- Example 2: Confidence 0.45 (45%) → Blocking review required, high error risk
- Example 3: Confidence 0.69 (69%) → Blocking review required (threshold boundary)

User Actions:
- User MUST review before proceeding
- User can confirm extraction (review_status → 'CONFIRMED')
- User can edit extraction (review_status → 'EDITED')
- User can reject extraction (review_status → 'REJECTED')
- User cannot proceed without review action

Error Handling:
- If confidence all <50%: Flag document quality issue, prompt user to verify scan quality
- If confidence <70%: Default to requiring review, cannot auto-accept

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.confidence_score < 0.70
- Field: obligations.review_status = 'PENDING' (blocking)
- Field: review_queue_items.review_type = 'LOW_CONFIDENCE'
- Field: review_queue_items.is_blocking = true

PLS Reference: Section A.5.2 (Confidence Thresholds), Section A.7.1 (Mandatory Human Review Scenarios), Section E.2.2 (Confidence Thresholds Application), Section E.4.1 (Review-Required Scenarios)



F.7 Human Review Required

Definition: Scenarios where human review is mandatory or recommended before an obligation can be activated or marked complete.

When Review is Required:

1. **Confidence Score <70%** (Blocking)
   - Reason: Uncertain extraction
   - UI Treatment: Red flag, blocking
   - Action: Cannot proceed without human confirmation

2. **Subjective Phrase Detected** (Non-blocking)
   - Reason: Requires interpretation
   - UI Treatment: Yellow badge, non-blocking
   - Action: User must add interpretation notes before marking complete

3. **No Rule Library Match** (Non-blocking)
   - Reason: Novel condition type
   - UI Treatment: Orange flag, review recommended
   - Action: Verify extraction accuracy for unknown patterns

4. **Date Parsing Failure** (Blocking)
   - Reason: Deadline uncertainty
   - UI Treatment: Red flag, blocking
   - Action: User must confirm or enter deadline date

5. **Conflicting Obligations Detected** (Non-blocking)
   - Reason: Logical inconsistency
   - UI Treatment: Orange flag, review recommended
   - Action: User must resolve conflict (choose one, keep both, or merge)

6. **OCR Quality <80%** (Blocking)
   - Reason: Document quality check
   - UI Treatment: Red flag, blocking
   - Action: Verify document scan quality, may need re-upload

7. **Potential Duplicate Detected** (Non-blocking)
   - Reason: Deduplication review
   - UI Treatment: Orange flag, review recommended
   - Action: User confirms if duplicate or keeps both

8. **Multi-Permit Same Site** (Information)
   - Reason: Potential overlap
   - UI Treatment: Information banner
   - Action: User reviews for overlapping obligations

Why Review is Required:
- Ensure extraction accuracy
- Verify subjective interpretations
- Confirm deadline dates
- Resolve conflicts and duplicates
- Validate document quality
- Maintain compliance integrity

What Triggers Review:
- System automatically flags items based on confidence, patterns, and validation rules
- Items added to Review Queue automatically
- Review Queue sorted by: Blocking status (blocking first), then document upload date

Review Workflow:
1. Items requiring review appear in "Review Queue" dashboard widget
2. User opens item, sees original text + extracted data side-by-side
3. User can: Confirm, Edit, or Reject extraction
4. Confirm/Edit: Item moves to active obligations
5. Reject: Item archived with status = 'REJECTED', rejection_reason required

Review Completion Tracking:
- reviewed_by: User ID
- reviewed_at: Timestamp
- review_action: enum (confirmed, edited, rejected)
- original_extraction: JSON snapshot of pre-review data
- review_notes: Optional text field

Maps To:
- Table: review_queue_items
- Field: review_queue_items.review_type (enum)
- Field: review_queue_items.is_blocking (BOOLEAN)
- Field: review_queue_items.review_status = 'PENDING'
- Field: obligations.review_status = 'PENDING'
- Enum: review_type (LOW_CONFIDENCE, SUBJECTIVE, NO_MATCH, DATE_FAILURE, DUPLICATE, OCR_QUALITY, CONFLICT)

PLS Reference: Section A.7 (Human Review Triggers), Section E.4 (Mandatory Human Review Nodes)


G. SUBJECTIVE WORDING PATTERNS

This section defines ALL phrases that trigger subjective obligation flagging. These patterns are used by the LLM to identify obligations requiring human interpretation.

G.1 Always Flag Phrases (100% Confidence)

These phrases ALWAYS trigger subjective flagging when detected in obligation text. No context evaluation is required.

Complete List:
1. "as appropriate"
2. "where necessary"
3. "where practicable"
4. "reasonable measures"
5. "adequate steps"
6. "as soon as practicable"
7. "to the satisfaction of"
8. "unless otherwise agreed"
9. "appropriate measures"
10. "suitable provision"
11. "best endeavours"
12. "reasonably practicable"

Detection Method:
- Exact match (case-insensitive, after text normalisation)
- Text normalised: lowercase, whitespace normalised
- Phrase must appear as complete phrase (not substring within larger word)

Examples:
- "Take appropriate measures" → Flags (contains "appropriate measures")
- "Where necessary, the operator shall..." → Flags (contains "where necessary")
- "As soon as practicable after the incident" → Flags (contains "as soon as practicable")
- "To the satisfaction of the regulator" → Flags (contains "to the satisfaction of")

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.is_subjective = true (BOOLEAN)
- Field: obligations.subjective_phrases (TEXT[]) - stores matched phrases
- Detection: Automatic during LLM extraction

PLS Reference: Section A.6.2 (Subjective Phrase Patterns), Section E.3.1 (Detection Methodology)



G.2 Context-Dependent Flag Phrases

These phrases trigger subjective flagging ONLY when specific qualifying criteria are missing. The LLM evaluates context to determine if flagging is required.

Complete List:
1. "regularly" (flag if no frequency specified)
2. "maintained" (flag if no criteria specified)
3. "adequate" (flag if no standard referenced)
4. "prevent" (flag if success criteria unclear)

Detection Method:
- Fuzzy match patterns (case-insensitive, after text normalisation)
- LLM evaluates context to determine if qualifying criteria present
- Flag only if qualifying criteria missing

Context Evaluation Rules:

1. "regularly" / "regular*"
   - Flag if: No specific frequency mentioned (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
   - Do NOT flag if: Frequency is specified ("regularly, at least weekly")
   - Example: "Monitor regularly" → Flags (no frequency)
   - Example: "Monitor regularly, at least monthly" → Does NOT flag (frequency specified)

2. "maintained" / "maintain*"
   - Flag if: No maintenance criteria specified (temperature, pressure, condition)
   - Do NOT flag if: Criteria specified ("maintained at 20°C", "maintained in good condition")
   - Example: "Equipment shall be maintained" → Flags (no criteria)
   - Example: "Equipment shall be maintained at operating temperature" → Does NOT flag (criteria specified)

3. "adequate" / "adequate*"
   - Flag if: No standard or reference specified
   - Do NOT flag if: Standard referenced ("adequate as per BS EN standard", "adequate for purpose")
   - Example: "Provide adequate ventilation" → Flags (no standard)
   - Example: "Provide adequate ventilation as per Building Regulations" → Does NOT flag (standard referenced)

4. "prevent" / "prevent*"
   - Flag if: Success criteria unclear (how to verify prevention)
   - Do NOT flag if: Success criteria specified ("prevent odour complaints", "prevent emissions exceeding limits")
   - Example: "Prevent pollution" → Flags (unclear success criteria)
   - Example: "Prevent odour complaints at boundary" → Does NOT flag (success criteria: no complaints)

Examples:
- "Monitor regularly" → Flags (no frequency specified)
- "Monitor regularly, at least weekly" → Does NOT flag (frequency specified)
- "Maintain equipment" → Flags (no criteria specified)
- "Maintain temperature at 20°C" → Does NOT flag (criteria: 20°C)
- "Provide adequate containment" → Flags (no standard referenced)
- "Provide adequate containment as per EA guidance" → Does NOT flag (standard referenced)
- "Prevent emissions" → Flags (success criteria unclear)
- "Prevent emissions exceeding 50 mg/m³" → Does NOT flag (success criteria: <50 mg/m³)

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.is_subjective = true (BOOLEAN) - if context evaluation determines flagging required
- Field: obligations.subjective_phrases (TEXT[]) - stores matched phrases with context note
- Detection: LLM context evaluation during extraction

PLS Reference: Section A.6.2 (Subjective Phrase Patterns), Section E.3.1 (Fuzzy Match Patterns)



G.3 Detection Methodology

Detection Workflow:
1. Text normalisation: Convert to lowercase, normalise whitespace
2. Exact match check: Check against Always Flag phrase list
3. Fuzzy match check: Check against Context-Dependent patterns
4. Context evaluation: For fuzzy matches, evaluate if qualifying criteria present
5. Flag setting: If match found (exact or context-dependent), set is_subjective = true
6. Phrase storage: Store matched phrases in subjective_phrases array

Text Normalisation Rules:
- Convert entire text to lowercase
- Normalise whitespace (multiple spaces → single space)
- Remove leading/trailing whitespace
- Preserve punctuation for phrase boundary detection

Phrase Matching Rules:
- Phrases matched as complete phrases (word boundaries respected)
- "as appropriate" matches "as appropriate" but not "appropriate measures" (different phrase)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handles variations: "where necessary" matches "Where Necessary", "WHERE NECESSARY"

Storage Format:
- subjective_phrases: TEXT[] array
- Each matched phrase stored as separate array element
- Example: ["as appropriate", "where necessary"]
- Context-dependent flags include context note: ["regularly (no frequency)"]

Detection Timing:
- Performed during LLM extraction (Section B.2.3)
- Applied to each obligation text extracted
- Results stored immediately in obligation record

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.is_subjective (BOOLEAN)
- Field: obligations.subjective_phrases (TEXT[])
- Process: Document Ingestion Pipeline → Obligation Extraction → Subjective Detection

PLS Reference: Section E.3.2 (Detection Workflow), Section B.2.3 (LLM Extraction)



G.4 System Behavior for Subjective Obligations

When subjective phrases are detected:

1. Flag Setting:
   - obligations.is_subjective = true (system-determined, cannot be overridden)
   - Matched phrases stored in obligations.subjective_phrases array

2. UI Treatment:
   - Obligation displayed with "Requires Interpretation" badge (yellow/orange)
   - Badge is non-removable (system-determined flag)
   - Obligation text highlighted to draw attention

3. User Requirements:
   - User MUST add interpretation notes before marking obligation complete
   - System prompts: "How will you demonstrate compliance with this obligation?"
   - User must provide:
     * Evidence type that will demonstrate compliance
     * Interpretation rationale explaining how evidence satisfies obligation

4. Evidence Requirements:
   - Evidence can be linked as normal
   - Interpretation notes stored separately in obligations.interpretation_notes
   - Both evidence and interpretation included in audit pack

5. Audit Pack Inclusion:
   - Subjective obligations include:
     * Original obligation text
     * User's interpretation notes
     * Linked evidence
     * Rationale for evidence selection

6. Flag Persistence:
   - Flag cannot be removed by user (system-determined)
   - Flag persists even if user edits obligation text
   - Only system can change is_subjective flag (based on re-extraction)

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.is_subjective (BOOLEAN) - read-only for users
- Field: obligations.subjective_phrases (TEXT[]) - read-only for users
- Field: obligations.interpretation_notes (TEXT) - user-editable, required for completion
- UI: Badge display, interpretation prompt, completion blocking

PLS Reference: Section A.6.3 (Subjective Flag Workflow), Section A.6.4 (Subjective Obligation Evidence), Section B.11.1 (Manual Override Rules)



G.5 Examples of Subjective vs Objective Obligations

Subjective Obligations (Flagged):

Example 1:
- Text: "The operator shall take appropriate measures to prevent odour"
- Detected Phrases: ["appropriate measures", "prevent (no success criteria)"]
- Reason: Contains "appropriate measures" (always flag) and "prevent" without clear success criteria
- Interpretation Required: User must explain what measures will be taken and how odour prevention will be demonstrated

Example 2:
- Text: "Maintain equipment as appropriate"
- Detected Phrases: ["as appropriate"]
- Reason: Contains "as appropriate" (always flag)
- Interpretation Required: User must explain what "appropriate" maintenance means in this context

Example 3:
- Text: "Monitor regularly and record results"
- Detected Phrases: ["regularly (no frequency)"]
- Reason: Contains "regularly" without frequency specification
- Interpretation Required: User must specify monitoring frequency

Example 4:
- Text: "Provide adequate containment to the satisfaction of the regulator"
- Detected Phrases: ["adequate (no standard)", "to the satisfaction of"]
- Reason: Contains "adequate" without standard reference and "to the satisfaction of" (always flag)
- Interpretation Required: User must explain what "adequate" means and how regulator satisfaction will be demonstrated

Objective Obligations (Not Flagged):

Example 1:
- Text: "Monitor pH weekly and record results"
- Detected Phrases: None
- Reason: Clear frequency (weekly), clear parameter (pH), clear action (record)
- No Interpretation Required: System can track compliance automatically

Example 2:
- Text: "Submit annual return by 31 January each year"
- Detected Phrases: None
- Reason: Clear deadline (31 January), clear frequency (annual)
- No Interpretation Required: System can generate schedule and track deadline

Example 3:
- Text: "Maintain noise levels below 45dB at boundary"
- Detected Phrases: None
- Reason: Clear limit (45dB), clear location (boundary), measurable
- No Interpretation Required: System can track compliance with monitoring evidence

Example 4:
- Text: "Keep records for 6 years from date of creation"
- Detected Phrases: None
- Reason: Clear duration (6 years), clear start point (date of creation)
- No Interpretation Required: System can track record retention

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.is_subjective (BOOLEAN) - false for objective, true for subjective
- Field: obligations.interpretation_notes (TEXT) - required for subjective, optional for objective

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.category = 'MONITORING' (enum: obligation_category)
- Used in: Obligation extraction, evidence suggestions, schedule generation

Escalation Logic:
- Monitoring obligations typically have regular deadlines
- Overdue monitoring may indicate compliance risk
- Escalation follows standard deadline escalation chain

PLS Reference: Section A.2.1 (Category Definitions), Section C.1.6 (Evidence Types for Module 1)



H.2 Category: Reporting

Definition: Submitting data/reports to regulators. Obligations that require periodic submission of data, reports, or notifications to regulatory bodies.

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.category = 'REPORTING' (enum: obligation_category)
- Used in: Obligation extraction, deadline calculation, submission tracking

Escalation Logic:
- Reporting obligations have fixed deadlines (often statutory)
- Missing reports may trigger regulatory action

- Default if uncertain: Record-Keeping (safest default category)

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.category = 'RECORD_KEEPING' (enum: obligation_category)
- Used in: Obligation extraction, evidence linking, retention tracking

Escalation Logic:
- Record-keeping obligations typically ongoing (no fixed deadlines)
- Compliance based on evidence presence, not deadline completion
- Lower escalation priority than time-bound obligations
- May escalate if records missing during audit period

PLS Reference: Section A.2.1 (Category Definitions), Section A.2.2 (Category Assignment Rules), Section C.1.6 (Evidence Types for Module 1)



H.4 Category: Operational

Default Frequency: Continuous/Ongoing (operational requirements are constant)

Default Evidence Types:
- Photos (operational compliance)
- Inspection checklists (PDF)
- Procedure documents (PDF)
- Training certificates
- Operational logs
- Site inspection reports

Category Assignment:
- LLM extracts category based on keywords: "operate", "operational", "procedure", "practice", "during operations", "containment", "handling"
- Confidence threshold: ≥85% for auto-assignment
- Default if uncertain: Record-Keeping

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.category = 'OPERATIONAL' (enum: obligation_category)
- Used in: Obligation extraction, evidence suggestions, compliance tracking

Escalation Logic:
- Operational obligations are continuous (no fixed deadlines)

- Escalation follows standard deadline escalation chain
- May have higher priority if equipment critical to compliance

Special Cases:
- Stack tests (Module 3) are Maintenance category
- Calibration requirements are Maintenance category
- Maintenance records can link to run-hour records (Module 3)

PLS Reference: Section A.2.1 (Category Definitions), Section C.1.6 (Evidence Types for Module 1), Section C.3.5 (Maintenance Logic), Section C.3.6 (Stack Test Scheduling)



H.6 Category Assignment Rules

General Rules:
1. LLM extracts category based on obligation text during parsing
2. Confidence threshold: ≥85% for auto-assignment; <85% flags for human review
3. Human override: Users can change category at any time; override is logged
4. Default if uncertain: Record-Keeping (lowest consequence for miscategorisation)

Assignment Process:
1. LLM analyzes obligation text for category keywords
2. LLM assigns category with confidence score
3. If confidence ≥85%: Auto-assigned, user can still edit
4. If confidence <85%: Flagged for review, user must confirm or change
5. User can override category at any time (logged in audit trail)

Category Impact:
- Determines default evidence types suggested to user
- Influences default frequency if not specified in text
- Affects escalation logic and priority
- Used in audit pack organization
- Used in dashboard filtering and reporting

Maps To:
- Field: obligations.category (enum: obligation_category)
- Field: obligations.confidence_score (affects auto-assignment)
- Field: obligations.review_status (if confidence <85%, flagged for review)
- Process: Obligation Extraction → Category Assignment → Review (if needed)

I. RELATIONSHIP DEFINITIONS

This section defines ALL relationships between entities in the system. Each relationship specifies type, foreign keys, cardinality, cascade rules, and business logic.

I.1 Core Hierarchy Relationships

Relationship: Company → Site

Type: One-to-Many

Foreign Key: sites.company_id → companies.id

Cardinality: One Company has Many Sites (0 to N sites per company)

Cascade Rules: ON DELETE CASCADE (if company deleted, all sites deleted)

Business Logic:
- Sites belong to exactly one company
- Sites cannot exist without a company
- Multi-site companies are supported
- Site deletion cascades to all related data (documents, obligations, evidence)

PLS Reference: Section A.1.2 (Data Flow Hierarchy), Section B.9 (Cross-Site Logic)

Maps To:
- Table: sites.company_id (FOREIGN KEY)
- Table: companies.id (PRIMARY KEY)



Relationship: Site → Document (Primary)

Type: One-to-Many

Foreign Key: documents.site_id → sites.id

Cardinality: One Site has Many Documents (0 to N documents per site as primary site)

Relationship: Document ↔ Site (Many-to-Many for Multi-Site Shared Permits)

Type: Many-to-Many

Join Table: document_site_assignments

Foreign Keys:
- document_site_assignments.document_id → documents.id
- document_site_assignments.site_id → sites.id

Cardinality: One Document can be linked to Many Sites; One Site can have Many Documents (via join table)

Cascade Rules: ON DELETE CASCADE (if document or site deleted, assignments deleted)

Business Logic:
- Allows one document (permit/consent/registration) to cover multiple sites
- Primary site stored in documents.site_id; additional sites in document_site_assignments
- User selects "Multiple sites" during upload and chooses which sites
- Obligations can be shared across sites or replicated per site (user choice via obligations_shared flag)
- Evidence can be linked site-specifically or across all linked sites (controlled exception to cross-site prohibition)

PLS Reference: Section J.5 (Multi-Site Shared Permits)

Maps To:
- Table: document_site_assignments (join table)
- Table: document_site_assignments.document_id (FOREIGN KEY)
- Table: document_site_assignments.site_id (FOREIGN KEY)

Cascade Rules: ON DELETE CASCADE (if site deleted, all documents deleted)

Business Logic:
- Documents have a primary site (via site_id, required)
- Documents can be linked to additional sites via document_site_assignments (for multi-site shared permits)
- Documents cannot exist without at least one site
- Multiple documents per site supported (multiple permits, consents, registrations)
- Document deletion cascades to obligations and document_site_assignments

PLS Reference: Section A.1.2 (Data Flow Hierarchy), Section A.4.1 (Document → Obligation Relationship), Section J.5 (Multi-Site Shared Permits)

Maps To:
- Table: documents.site_id (FOREIGN KEY) - primary site
- Table: sites.id (PRIMARY KEY)
- Table: document_site_assignments (join table for additional sites)



Relationship: Document → Obligation

Type: One-to-Many

Foreign Key: obligations.document_id → documents.id

Cardinality: One Document has Many Obligations (1 to N obligations per document, typically 50-200)

Cascade Rules: ON DELETE CASCADE (if document deleted, obligations archived with reason "source_document_removed")

Business Logic:
- Every obligation MUST link to exactly one document (no orphan obligations)
- One document generates multiple obligations
- If document deleted, obligations archived (not deleted) with archived_reason = "source_document_removed"
- Obligations cannot exist without a document

PLS Reference: Section A.4.1 (Document → Obligation Relationship)

Maps To:
- Table: obligations.document_id (FOREIGN KEY)

- uq_user_site_assignments

Composite Indexes: idx_{table}_{column1}_{column2}
- idx_deadlines_status_due_date
- idx_obligations_category_status

PLS Reference: Section A.7 (Index Naming)

Rationale:
- JSONB fields can be queried by key or value
- GIN indexes support JSONB operators (->, ->>, @>, ?)
- Not currently implemented but may be added

Future Enhancement: GIN indexes on JSONB fields if querying is required



N.9 Index Maintenance

Index Creation:
- Indexes created during table creation (migration scripts)
- Indexes named according to convention
- Indexes documented in table definitions (Section C)

Index Monitoring:
- Monitor index usage (pg_stat_user_indexes)
- Identify unused indexes for removal
- Monitor index size and bloat

Index Optimization:
- Regular VACUUM and REINDEX for maintenance
- Analyze tables after bulk inserts
- Monitor query performance and add indexes as needed

Index Trade-offs:
