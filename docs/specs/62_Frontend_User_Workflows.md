# 1. INTRODUCTION

This document defines complete step-by-step user journey maps for all workflows in the EcoComply Platform. Each workflow specifies the user actions, system responses, decision points, and error paths.

**Terminology Note:** All entity names, field names, statuses, and enums match the Canonical Dictionary exactly.

**Module Extension Note:** New modules define their own workflows following the same pattern as Modules 1, 2, and 3. Module activation workflows query `modules.requires_module_id` to determine prerequisites and activation flow. Workflows can be registered per module in the `modules.workflow_config` JSONB field (optional). See Canonical Dictionary Section B.31 (Module Extension Pattern) and Product Logic Specification Section C.4 (Module Extension Pattern - business logic) for guidance on adding new modules and their workflows. For the `modules` table structure, see Canonical Dictionary Section C.4 (Module Registry Table).

# 2. MODULE 1: ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS

## 2.1 Permit Upload & Extraction

### Starting Point
- **Trigger:** User clicks "Upload Permit" on Site dashboard
- **Prerequisites:** User has Staff, Admin, or Owner role; Site exists; Required modules (defined in modules.requires_module_id) are active

### Step-by-Step Flow

**Upload Method Selection:**
1. **User:** Clicks "Upload Permit" button on Site dashboard
2. **System:** Shows upload method selector: "Upload PDF" (default) OR "Import from Excel"
3. **User:** Selects upload method

**PDF Upload Path:**
1. **User:** Clicks "Upload PDF" option (or default selection)

2. **System:** Displays upload modal with drag-drop zone
   - Shows accepted format: PDF only
   - Shows maximum file size: 50MB

3. **User:** Drags and drops PDF file (or uses file picker)

4. **System:** Validates file
   - **If** file type is not PDF, **then** display error "Only PDF files are accepted" and reject upload
   - **If** file size exceeds 50MB, **then** display error "File exceeds 50MB limit" and reject upload
   - **Else** proceed to Step 5

5. **System:** Uploads file to secure storage
   - Creates Document record with `status = DRAFT`
   - Creates ExtractionLog record with `extraction_status = PENDING`
   - Stores original filename in metadata
   - Assigns UUID as system filename

6. **System:** Detects file format
   - **If** native PDF, **then** proceed to direct text extraction
   - **If** scanned PDF, **then** proceed to OCR processing

7. **System:** Performs OCR processing (if required)
   - **If** OCR confidence < 80%, **then** flag Document for manual review with message "Document quality issues detected"
   - **If** processing time exceeds 60 seconds, **then** set `extraction_status = FAILED` and prompt user to re-upload better scan

8. **System:** Extracts full document text
   - Preserves page numbers
   - Identifies headers/footers
   - Normalises character encoding to UTF-8

9. **System:** Segments document into sections
   - Identifies section headers by pattern (numbered, capitalised)
   - Creates segment boundaries
   - Tags each segment with type (header, conditions, schedules, etc.)

10. **System:** Performs module routing
    - Identifies document type from keywords and structure
    - Queries `modules` table: `SELECT * FROM modules WHERE document_types @> '["<document_type>"]'::JSONB AND is_active = true`
    - **If** exactly one module matches, **then** route to that module's extraction rules and set `documents.module_id`
    - **If** ambiguous (multiple module keywords or multiple modules match), **then** prompt user to confirm document type

11. **User:** (If prompted) Selects document type from dropdown

12. **System:** For each document segment, performs extraction:
    - First attempts Rule Library Lookup (pattern match ≥90% uses library template)
    - Falls back to LLM Extraction if no match
    - Calculates confidence_score for each Obligation
    - Detects subjective phrases and sets `is_subjective = true` where applicable
    - Performs hallucination detection:
      - Checks if extracted text found in source document
      - Validates numeric values against document
      - Checks dates are within reasonable range
      - Validates categories match document type
      - **If** hallucination detected, **then**:
        - Set `hallucination_risk = true`
        - Set `is_blocking = true`
        - Set `priority = 999` (highest priority)
        - Set `review_type = 'HALLUCINATION'`
        - **Auto-escalation:** If `hallucination_risk = true` AND `confidence_score < 50%`, **then**:
          - Automatically escalate to Admin/Owner review queue
          - Send immediate notification to Admin/Owner
          - Block document activation until reviewed
        - **Threshold-based escalation:** If hallucination detected in 3+ obligations in same document, **then**:
          - Escalate entire document for manual review
          - Flag document as `extraction_status = 'REVIEW_REQUIRED'`
          - Prevent document activation

13. **System:** Creates Obligation records
    - Links each Obligation to Document
    - Sets initial `status = PENDING`
    - Sets `review_status = PENDING` for items requiring review
    - Flags items with `confidence_score < 85%` for human review (non-blocking)
    - Flags items with `confidence_score < 70%` as blocking (requires review before activation)
    - Creates ReviewQueueItem records for all flagged items:
      - Items with `confidence_score < 85%` → `review_type = LOW_CONFIDENCE`, `is_blocking = false` (if ≥70%), `is_blocking = true` (if <70%)
      - Items with `is_subjective = true` → `review_type = SUBJECTIVE`, `is_blocking = false`
      - Items with hallucination detected → `review_type = NO_MATCH` (or appropriate type), `hallucination_risk = true`, `is_blocking = true`, `priority = elevated`
      - Items with other review triggers → appropriate `review_type` (DATE_FAILURE, DUPLICATE, OCR_QUALITY, CONFLICT)

14. **System:** Updates Document record
    - Sets `extraction_status = COMPLETED` (or `REVIEW_REQUIRED` if flagged items exist)
    - Displays extraction summary to user

15. **System:** Displays extraction results screen
    - Shows total Obligations extracted
    - Shows count of items flagged for review
    - Shows disclaimer: "Extracted obligations are derived by AI and may contain errors..."

16. **User:** Reviews extraction summary and proceeds to Obligation Review workflow

**Excel Import Path:**
1. **User:** Clicks "Import from Excel" option
2. **System:** Shows Excel import form with file dropzone (accepts .xlsx, .xls, .csv)
3. **User:** Drags Excel file OR clicks to browse
4. **System:** Validates file format (must be .xlsx, .xls, or .csv)
5. **System:** Validates file size (must be ≤10MB) and row count (must be ≤10,000 rows)
6. **User:** Selects import options (create missing sites, create missing permits, skip duplicates)
7. **User:** Clicks "Import" button
8. **System:** Uploads file, creates import record, triggers background job
9. **System:** Shows "Processing..." message with import ID
10. **Background Job:** Validates file, parses rows, validates data (dates, frequencies, required fields)
11. **Background Job:** Creates preview (valid rows, errors, warnings)
12. **System:** Sends notification: "Excel import ready for review"
13. **User:** Receives notification, clicks review link
14. **System:** Shows import preview page with:
    - Valid rows table (shows obligations to be created)
    - Errors table (shows rows with errors, error messages)
    - Warnings table (shows rows with warnings, e.g., duplicates)
15. **User:** Reviews preview, edits errors if needed (optional)
16. **User:** Clicks "Confirm Import" button
17. **Background Job:** Creates obligations in bulk from valid rows
18. **Background Job:** Links obligations to permits/sites
19. **System:** Sends notification: "Excel import completed - X obligations imported"
20. **User:** Receives notification, clicks "View Obligations"
21. **System:** Navigates to obligations list, shows imported obligations

### End States
- **PDF Upload Success:** Document `status = DRAFT`, Obligations created, user proceeds to review
- **PDF Upload Partial Success:** Document processed with some items flagged for review
- **PDF Upload Failure:** Document rejected, user prompted to re-upload
- **Excel Import Success:** Obligations created in bulk, user navigates to obligations list
- **Excel Import Failure:** Import fails, user receives error notification with retry option

### Error Paths

## 2.1.1 Subjective Interpretation Workflow

### Starting Point
- **Trigger:** System flags obligation as `is_subjective = true` during extraction
- **Context:** Obligation contains language requiring human interpretation (e.g., "reasonable measures", "best practice", "as appropriate")

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **System:** Flags obligation during extraction
   - Sets `obligation.is_subjective = true`
   - Sets `obligation.review_status = 'PENDING_INTERPRETATION'`
   - Sets `obligation.status = 'PENDING'` (cannot be marked complete until interpreted)

2. **System:** Displays obligation in "Subjective Review Queue"
   - Appears in dedicated queue for Staff/Admin/Owner roles
   - Badge indicator: "Requires Interpretation"
   - Shows original extracted text

3. **User (Staff/Admin/Owner):** Reviews subjective obligation
   - Clicks on obligation from review queue
   - Views original extracted text
   - Views document context (full document available)

4. **User:** Provides interpretation
   - **Option A:** Add interpretation notes (required)
     - User enters interpretation in `obligation.interpretation_notes` field
     - Example: "Reasonable measures = weekly visual inspection + monthly meter reading"
   - **Option B:** Mark as non-applicable
     - If obligation doesn't apply to this site/company
     - Sets `obligation.status = 'NOT_APPLICABLE'`
     - Requires reason: `obligation.interpretation_notes = "Reason: [explanation]"`

5. **System:** Updates obligation
   - **If** interpretation provided, **then**:
     - Sets `obligation.review_status = 'INTERPRETED'`
     - Sets `obligation.status = 'PENDING'` (now actionable)
     - Sets `obligation.interpreted_by = user_id`
     - Sets `obligation.interpreted_at = NOW()`
     - Removes from review queue
   - **If** marked N/A, **then**:
     - Sets `obligation.review_status = 'NOT_APPLICABLE'`
     - Sets `obligation.status = 'NOT_APPLICABLE'`
     - Removes from review queue

6. **System:** Creates compliance obligation from interpretation
   - **If** interpretation provided, **then** system may create derived obligations:
     - Example: "Reasonable measures" → creates "Weekly visual inspection" + "Monthly meter reading" obligations
     - Derived obligations link to original via `obligation.parent_obligation_id`
   - Derived obligations have `is_subjective = false` (now concrete)

### End States
- **Interpreted:** Obligation has interpretation notes, is actionable, removed from queue
- **Not Applicable:** Obligation marked N/A with reason, removed from queue
- **Pending:** Still awaiting interpretation (remains in queue)

### Error Paths
- **No Interpretation Provided:** System prevents saving until `interpretation_notes` field is populated
- **Invalid Interpretation:** System validates interpretation notes are non-empty and meaningful (min 10 characters)

---

## 2.2 Obligation Review & Editing

### Starting Point
- **Trigger:** User completes permit upload OR user clicks "Review Queue" dashboard widget
- **Prerequisites:** Document has Obligations with `review_status = PENDING`

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User:** Navigates to Review Queue (via prompt after upload or dashboard widget)

2. **System:** Displays Review Queue
    - Shows items sorted by: priority DESC (highest first), then blocking status (blocking first), then Document upload date
    - Shows for each item: Document name, Obligation text snippet, review type badge, hallucination risk indicator (if `hallucination_risk = true`)
    - Review type badges: LOW_CONFIDENCE (yellow), SUBJECTIVE (orange), NO_MATCH (red), DATE_FAILURE (amber), DUPLICATE (blue), OCR_QUALITY (grey), CONFLICT (red), HALLUCINATION (red with warning icon)

3. **User:** Clicks on an item to review

4. **System:** Opens side-by-side review screen
    - Left panel: Original document text with page reference
    - Right panel: Extracted Obligation data (text, summary, category, frequency, deadline)
    - Highlights confidence_score with colour coding:
      - ≥85%: Green (Confirmed)
      - 70-84%: Yellow (Review Recommended)
      - <70%: Red (Review Required)
    - **If** `hallucination_risk = true`, **then** displays prominent warning banner: "⚠️ Hallucination Risk: Extracted text may not match source document. Please verify carefully."
    - Shows review type badge and `is_blocking` indicator

5. **User:** Reviews extraction against original text
    - **If** extraction is correct, **then** clicks "Confirm"
    - **If** extraction needs editing, **then** modifies fields and clicks "Save"
    - **If** extraction is invalid, **then** clicks "Reject"

6. **System:** Processes user action
    - **If** Confirm:
      - Sets `review_status = CONFIRMED`
      - Sets `status = PENDING` (active)
      - Logs: `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `review_action = confirmed`
    - **If** Save (with edits):
      - Stores original extraction in `original_extraction` field
      - Updates Obligation fields with new values
      - Sets `review_status = EDITED`
      - Requires user to provide edit reason
      - Logs: all changes with previous values
    - **If** Reject:
      - Requires user to provide rejection reason
      - Sets `review_status = REJECTED`
      - Sets Obligation `status = REJECTED`
      - Archives Obligation (not deleted)

7. **User:** (For subjective Obligations) Adds interpretation notes
    - System prompts: "How will you demonstrate compliance with this obligation?"
    - User enters interpretation notes (required before marking complete later)

8. **System:** Updates Review Queue count

9. **User:** Continues reviewing remaining items until queue is empty

10. **System:** Validates subjective obligations before allowing completion:
    - **If** any obligation has `is_subjective = true` AND `interpretation_notes` IS NULL, **then**:
      - System blocks document activation
      - Displays error: "The following obligations require interpretation before the document can be activated: [list of subjective obligations]"
      - User must navigate to interpretation workflow for each subjective obligation
      - System prevents `extraction_status = COMPLETED` until all subjective obligations have interpretation notes
    - **If** all subjective obligations have interpretation notes, **then** proceed to Step 11

11. **System:** When all blocking items reviewed and subjective obligations interpreted:
    - Updates Document `extraction_status = COMPLETED`
    - Updates Document `status = ACTIVE`
    - Generates Schedules for all active Obligations with defined frequencies

### End States
- **Review Complete:** All Obligations reviewed; Document is ACTIVE
- **Partial Review:** Some items still in queue; Document remains in REVIEW_REQUIRED status

### Error Paths
- **Conflicting Obligations Detected:** Both Obligations displayed with conflict badge; user must choose one, keep both, or merge

---

## 2.3 Evidence Capture & Linking

### Starting Point
- **Trigger:** User clicks "Upload Evidence" from Site dashboard, Obligation detail page, or mobile camera capture
- **Prerequisites:** Site exists; at least one active Obligation exists

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User:** Initiates evidence upload via one of:
    - Dashboard "Upload Evidence" button
    - Obligation detail page "Add Evidence" button
    - Mobile camera capture (opens camera directly)

2. **System:** Displays upload interface
    - Shows drag-drop zone (or camera viewfinder on mobile)
    - Lists supported types: PDF (50MB), Images (20MB), CSV/XLSX (10MB), ZIP (100MB)

3. **User:** Uploads file or captures photo
    - For mobile capture: auto-captures GPS coordinates (if permitted), auto-captures timestamp

4. **System:** Validates file
    - **If** file type not supported, **then** display error and reject
    - **If** file exceeds size limit, **then** display error and reject
    - **If** file integrity check fails, **then** flag as corrupted
    - **Else** proceed to Step 5

5. **System:** Creates EvidenceItem record
    - Generates unique `evidence_id`
    - Sets `uploaded_by` to current User
    - Sets `uploaded_at` to current timestamp
    - Stores file in secure storage with generated `storage_path`
    - Generates thumbnail (for images)

6. **User:** (Optional) Adds description/notes

7. **System:** Displays linking interface
    - **If** uploaded from Obligation detail page, **then** auto-suggests that Obligation
    - Shows list of active Obligations with search/filter
    - Shows suggested links based on: filename matching condition reference, upload date matching deadline, evidence type matching Obligation category

8. **User:** Selects Obligation(s) to link
    - Can select multiple Obligations (up to 20)
    - Can add linking notes for each
    - **If** user attempts to skip linking (clicks "Skip" or "Cancel"), **then**:
      - System displays warning: "Evidence must be linked to an obligation within 7 days. You can link it later, but it will not be used for compliance verification until linked."
      - Evidence is saved with `enforcement_status = 'PENDING_LINK'`
      - 7-day grace period timer starts

9. **System:** Creates ObligationEvidenceLink records
    - **If** obligation link created, **then**:
      - Sets `evidence.enforcement_status = 'LINKED'`
      - Evidence can be used for compliance verification
    - **If** no obligation link created, **then**:
      - Sets `evidence.enforcement_status = 'PENDING_LINK'`
      - 7-day grace period timer starts
      - Evidence cannot be used for compliance verification until linked
    - Sets `linked_by` to current User
    - Sets `linked_at` to current timestamp
    - Sets `compliance_period` based on Obligation's current period
    - Validates: EvidenceItem exists, Obligation not archived
    - Validates site linking:
      - **If** EvidenceItem and Obligation are on same Site, **then** allow linking
      - **If** EvidenceItem and Obligation are on different Sites, **then** check if both are linked to same multi-site shared permit:
        - Check if Obligation's Document has `document_site_assignments` records
        - Check if EvidenceItem's Site is in those assignments
        - **If** yes, **then** allow linking (controlled exception for multi-site shared permits)
        - **If** no, **then** reject with error: "Evidence cannot be linked to obligations on different sites"

10. **System:** Updates Obligation status
    - **If** evidence upload date within compliance period, **then** set Obligation `status = COMPLETED`
    - **If** evidence upload date after deadline, **then** set Obligation `status = LATE_COMPLETE`
    - **If** compliance period has ended and no evidence linked for that period, **then** set Obligation `status = INCOMPLETE`

11. **System:** Displays confirmation
    - Shows linked Obligations
    - Shows updated compliance status

### End States
- **Success:** EvidenceItem created and linked; Obligation status updated to COMPLETED or LATE_COMPLETE
- **Evidence Not Linked:** EvidenceItem created but not linked (appears in "Unlinked Evidence" widget)

### Error Paths
- **Storage Error:** Evidence not saved; retry prompt displayed, then support contact
- **Link Validation Failure:** Cross-site linking attempted; error displayed: "Evidence cannot be linked to obligations on different sites **unless both are linked to the same multi-site shared permit**"

---

## 2.4 Obligation Completion Workflow

### Starting Point
- **Trigger:** User marks obligation as complete OR evidence is linked to obligation
- **Prerequisites:** Obligation exists and is in PENDING or DUE_SOON status

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User:** Initiates completion via one of:
   - Clicks "Mark Complete" on obligation detail page
   - Links evidence to obligation (auto-completes if within compliance period)
   - Uploads evidence from obligation detail page (auto-links and completes)

2. **System:** Validates completion prerequisites
   - **If** `is_subjective = true` AND `interpretation_notes` IS NULL, **then**:
     - Block completion with error: "This obligation requires interpretation before it can be marked complete. Please add interpretation notes."
     - User must navigate to interpretation workflow (Section 2.1.1)
   - **If** obligation has required evidence types AND no evidence linked, **then**:
     - Display warning: "This obligation typically requires evidence. Are you sure you want to mark it complete without evidence?"
     - User can proceed with justification or cancel to upload evidence
   - **If** deadline has passed AND no evidence linked, **then**:
     - Display warning: "Deadline has passed. Completing without evidence will mark as LATE_COMPLETE."
     - User can proceed or cancel to upload evidence

3. **User:** (Optional) Provides completion justification
   - If marking complete without evidence, system prompts for reason
   - Reason stored in `obligation.completion_notes`
   - Reason included in audit pack

4. **System:** Calculates completion status
   - **If** evidence linked AND evidence upload date ≤ deadline, **then**:
     - Set `obligation.status = COMPLETED`
     - Set `obligation.completed_at = NOW()`
   - **If** evidence linked AND evidence upload date > deadline, **then**:
     - Set `obligation.status = LATE_COMPLETE`
     - Set `obligation.completed_at = NOW()`
     - Set `obligation.late_reason = 'Evidence uploaded after deadline'`
   - **If** no evidence AND deadline passed, **then**:
     - Set `obligation.status = LATE_COMPLETE`
     - Set `obligation.completed_at = NOW()`
     - Set `obligation.late_reason = 'Completed without evidence after deadline'`
   - **If** no evidence AND deadline not passed, **then**:
     - Set `obligation.status = COMPLETED`
     - Set `obligation.completed_at = NOW()`
     - Set `obligation.completion_notes = [user justification]`

5. **System:** Updates related entities
   - Updates Schedule: If obligation has schedule, marks schedule period as complete
   - Updates Deadline: If obligation has deadline, marks deadline as complete
   - Updates Evidence: If evidence linked, sets `evidence.compliance_status = 'LINKED_TO_COMPLETED'`
   - Triggers notifications: Sends completion notification to assigned user and site manager

6. **System:** Logs completion in audit trail
   - Creates AuditLog entry:
     - `action_type = 'OBLIGATION_COMPLETED'`
     - `entity_type = 'obligation'`
     - `entity_id = obligation.id`
     - `previous_values = {status: 'PENDING', ...}`
     - `new_values = {status: 'COMPLETED', completed_at: NOW(), ...}`
     - `user_id = current_user.id`

   - Shows completion timestamp
   - Shows linked evidence (if any)
   - Shows completion notes (if any)

### End States
- **Completed:** Obligation marked complete, evidence linked (if applicable), audit trail logged
- **Late Complete:** Obligation completed after deadline, late flag visible in audit pack
- **Blocked:** Obligation cannot be completed (subjective interpretation required, or other blocking condition)

### Error Paths
- **Subjective Interpretation Required:** User must add interpretation notes before completion
- **Evidence Validation Failure:** Evidence link fails validation (wrong site, wrong document, etc.)
- **Completion Blocked:** System prevents completion due to business rules

      - First: Document-specified start date
      - Second: Permit anniversary date
      - Third: Document upload date
      - Fourth: User-specified date

3. **System:** Calculates first deadline
    - Applies frequency rules:
      - DAILY: base_date + N days
      - WEEKLY: base_date + (N × 7) days
      - MONTHLY: base_date + N months (same day or last day if doesn't exist)
      - QUARTERLY: base_date + (N × 3) months
      - ANNUAL: base_date + N years
    - Sets `next_due_date`

4. **System:** Applies business day adjustment (if configured)
    - **If** `adjust_for_business_days = true` AND deadline falls on weekend/UK bank holiday
    - **Then** move deadline to previous working day

5. **System:** Creates Schedule record
    - Sets `status = ACTIVE`
    - Sets `is_rolling = false` (default; fixed schedule)
    - Sets `reminder_days = [7, 3, 1]` (default)

6. **System:** Generates Deadline record for next occurrence
    - Sets `status = PENDING`
    - Sets `due_date` from calculated date
    - Sets `compliance_period` based on frequency

7. **User:** (Optional) Clicks "Edit Schedule" to customise
    - Can modify: frequency, base_date, reminder_days, adjust_for_business_days, is_rolling
    - System requires reason for changes (logged to audit trail)

8. **System:** Recalculates all future deadlines if Schedule modified

### End States
- **Schedule Active:** Schedule created with ACTIVE status; generating deadlines
- **Schedule Paused:** User has paused schedule; no new deadlines generated

### Error Paths
- **No Frequency Defined:** Prompt user to set frequency before creating Schedule
- **Invalid Base Date:** Display validation error; require valid date

   - Calculates percentage: `(value / limit_value) * 100`

6. **System:** Checks thresholds and creates Exceedance if needed
   - **If** `value ≥ limit_value`, **then**:
     - Creates Exceedance record
     - Sets `exceedance.status = OPEN`
     - Sets `exceedance.severity = BREACH` (limit exceeded)
     - Triggers breach alert workflow (Section 3.4)
   - **If** `value ≥ (limit_value * 0.8)` AND `value < limit_value`, **then**:
     - Sets `parameter.warning_status = APPROACHING_LIMIT`
     - Sends warning notification (non-critical)
   - **If** `value < (limit_value * 0.8)`, **then**:
     - Sets `parameter.warning_status = NORMAL`
     - No action required

7. **User:** Investigates exceedance and takes corrective action
   - Views Exceedance details
   - Documents corrective action in `exceedance.resolution_notes`
   - Uploads evidence of corrective action (if required)

8. **User:** Marks Exceedance as resolved
   - Sets `exceedance.status = RESOLVED`
   - Records `resolved_at` timestamp
   - System logs resolution in audit trail

9. **System:** Updates Parameter status

# 5. CROSS-MODULE WORKFLOWS

**Note:** Cross-module workflows query `modules.requires_module_id` to determine prerequisites and activation flow. Module activation logic is data-driven (stored in `modules` table), not hardcoded. New modules automatically participate in cross-module workflows once registered. See Canonical Dictionary Section B.31 (Module Extension Pattern) and Product Logic Specification Section C.4 (Module Extension Pattern - business logic) for guidance. For the `modules` table structure, see Canonical Dictionary Section C.4 (Module Registry Table).

## 5.1 Module 2 Activation (from Module 1)

### Starting Point
- **Trigger:** Cross-sell trigger detected OR user manual activation
- **Prerequisites:** Prerequisite modules (defined in modules.requires_module_id) are active; user has Owner or Admin role

### Step-by-Step Flow

### Automatic Trigger Path:

1. **System:** During Module 1 document extraction, detects cross-sell keywords:
    - "trade effluent", "discharge consent", "water company", "sewer", "effluent", "discharge to drain"

2. **System:** Creates CrossSellTrigger record:
    - Queries `modules` table to find module that handles trade effluent: `SELECT id FROM modules WHERE cross_sell_keywords && ARRAY['trade effluent']::TEXT[] OR document_types @> '["TRADE_EFFLUENT_CONSENT"]'::JSONB`
    - Sets `target_module_id` to the returned UUID (not hardcoded MODULE_2)
    - Sets `trigger_type = KEYWORD`
    - Stores detected keywords
    - Sets `status = PENDING`

3. **System:** Displays banner on dashboard:
    - "We detected references to trade effluent in your permit. Would you like to activate Module 2?"
    - Buttons: "Activate" / "Dismiss"

4. **User:** Clicks "Activate"
    - OR clicks "Dismiss" (banner removed; trigger marked dismissed)

### Manual Activation Path:

1. **User:** Navigates to Company Settings > Modules

2. **User:** Clicks "Activate Module 2"

### Both Paths Continue:

5. **System:** Displays Module 2 activation confirmation:
    - Shows pricing: £59/month per site
    - Shows feature summary
    - Confirms billing update

6. **User:** Confirms activation

7. **System:** Creates ModuleActivation record:
    - Uses `module_id` from user's selection (UI displays modules from `modules` table, each with its UUID; user clicks "Activate" on specific module, system uses that module's UUID directly)
    - Sets `module_id` to the selected module's UUID (no query needed - module_id comes from UI)
    - Sets `status = ACTIVE`
    - Sets `activated_at` timestamp
    - Triggers billing update

8. **System:** Updates CrossSellTrigger (if from trigger):
    - Sets `status = CONVERTED`
    - Sets `response_action = activated`

9. **System:** Displays Module 2 dashboard
    - Shows "Upload Consent" prompt
    - Shows Module 2 widgets (initially empty)

10. **System:** Updates navigation:
    - Adds Module 2 to main navigation
    - Shows Module 2 widgets on main dashboard

### End States
- **Module Activated:** Module 2 features available; billing updated
- **Trigger Dismissed:** Banner removed; user can activate later from settings

### Error Paths
- **Prerequisites Not Met:** Display error "[Prerequisite Module Name] required"; block activation (system queries modules.requires_module_id to determine prerequisites)
- **Billing Failure:** Display payment error; activation rolls back

---

## 5.2 Module 3 Activation (from Module 1)

### Starting Point
- **Trigger:** Cross-sell trigger detected OR user manual activation
- **Prerequisites:** Prerequisite modules (defined in modules.requires_module_id) are active; user has Owner or Admin role

### Step-by-Step Flow

(Follows same pattern as Section 5.1 with Module 3 specifics)

### Automatic Trigger Path:

1. **System:** Detects keywords: "generator", "MCPD", "standby power", "CHP", "combustion plant", "back-up generator"

2. **System:** Creates CrossSellTrigger record:
    - Queries `modules` table to find module that handles generators/MCPD: `SELECT id FROM modules WHERE cross_sell_keywords && ARRAY['generator', 'MCPD']::TEXT[] OR document_types @> '["MCPD_REGISTRATION"]'::JSONB`
    - Sets `target_module_id` to the returned UUID (not hardcoded MODULE_3)
    - Sets `trigger_type = KEYWORD`
    - Stores detected keywords
    - Sets `status = PENDING`

3. **System:** Displays banner:
    - "We detected references to generators in your permit. Would you like to activate Module 3?"

### Activation:

4. **System:** Displays Module 3 activation confirmation:
    - Shows pricing: £79/month per company (not per site)
    - Shows feature summary

5. **User:** Confirms activation

6. **System:** Creates ModuleActivation record:

    - Sets `module_id` to the selected module's UUID (no query needed - module_id comes from UI)
    - Sets `status = ACTIVE`
    - Sets `activated_at` timestamp
    - Triggers billing update

7. **System:** Updates navigation and dashboard

### End States
- **Module Activated:** Module 3 features available
- **Trigger Dismissed:** User can activate later

### Error Paths
- Same as Module 2 activation
