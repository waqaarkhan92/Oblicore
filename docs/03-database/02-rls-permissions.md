# EcoComply RLS & Permissions Rules Specification

**EcoComply v1.0 — Launch-Ready / Last updated: 2025-12-05**

> [v1.2 UPDATE - Added 28 New Tables RLS Policies - 2025-12-05]
>
> Added RLS policies for:
> - Enhanced Features V2 (11 tables): evidence_gaps, content_embeddings, compliance_risk_scores, etc.
> - Regulatory Pack Engine (14 tables): elv_conditions, ccs_assessments, regulatory_packs, etc.
> - Ingestion Schema (2 tables): ingestion_sessions, subjective_interpretations
> - Review Queue Enhancement (1 table): review_queue_escalation_history

> [CRITICAL FIX - Schema Alignment - 2025-01-01]
> 
> **All RLS policies have been rewritten to match the actual database schema:**
> - Uses `users.company_id` for regular users (single company)
> - Uses `consultant_client_assignments` for consultants (multi-company)
> - All role checks use UPPERCASE ('OWNER', 'ADMIN', 'STAFF', 'CONSULTANT', 'VIEWER')
> - Uses `module_activations.status = 'ACTIVE'` instead of `is_active = TRUE`
> - Removed all references to non-existent `user_roles.company_id` and `user_site_assignments.role`

# 1. Document Overview

## 1.1 Security Architecture

The EcoComply platform uses **PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)** to enforce data isolation and access control at the database level. This ensures that:

- **Multi-tenant isolation:** Users can only access data from their assigned companies/sites
- **Role-based access control:** Permissions are enforced based on user roles (Owner, Admin, Staff, Viewer, Consultant)
- **Module-specific access:** Module 2 and Module 3 data requires module activation
- **Consultant isolation:** Consultants can only access assigned client companies/sites
- **Immutable audit trail:** Audit logs cannot be modified or deleted

## 1.2 RLS Enablement Strategy

**RLS Enabled Tables:** 36 tables
- All tenant-scoped tables have RLS enabled
- System tables (`background_jobs`, `dead_letter_queue`, `system_settings`) have RLS disabled
- Rule library tables (`rule_library_patterns`, `pattern_candidates`, `pattern_events`, `correction_records`) have RLS enabled

**Tables with RLS Disabled:**
- `background_jobs` - System table for job queue management (no tenant isolation needed)
- `dead_letter_queue` - System table for failed jobs (no tenant isolation needed)
- `system_settings` - Global system configuration (not tenant-scoped, RLS disabled per Database Schema Section 7.9)

**RLS Policy Coverage:**
- **SELECT policies:** Control read access based on company/site membership
- **INSERT policies:** Control create access based on role and site assignment
- **UPDATE policies:** Control update access based on role and ownership
- **DELETE policies:** Control delete access (typically restricted to Owners/Admins)

## 1.3 Permission Model

**Access Control Layers:**
1. **Database Level (RLS):** Enforced by PostgreSQL RLS policies
2. **API Level:** Validates permissions before operations
3. **Application Level:** UI hides/disabled actions based on permissions

**Role Hierarchy:**
- **Owner:** Full access to all entities within their company
- **Admin:** Full access except system settings (read-only) and rule library (read-only)
- **Staff:** Can create/update most entities, cannot delete or manage users/modules
- **Viewer:** Read-only access to all entities
- **Consultant:** Staff-level permissions but scoped to client companies only (multi-company access)

---

# 2. RLS Policy Structure

## 2.1 Policy Naming Convention

**Format:** `{table_name}_{operation}_{scope}`

**Examples:**
- `companies_select_user_access` - SELECT policy for companies table
- `documents_insert_staff_access` - INSERT policy for documents table (Staff+ roles)
- `obligations_update_staff_access` - UPDATE policy for obligations table (Staff+ roles)
- `evidence_items_delete_none` - DELETE policy (no one can delete)

## 2.2 Policy Components

**Required Components:**
- **Policy name:** Unique identifier following naming convention
- **Table name:** Target table for the policy
- **Operation:** SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
- **Policy condition (USING clause):** For SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE - determines which rows are visible/accessible
- **Policy action (WITH CHECK clause):** For INSERT, UPDATE - validates data before insertion/update

## 2.3 Policy Pattern Examples

**SELECT Policy Pattern:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY {table}_select_{scope} ON {table}
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Access condition (e.g., site_id IN user's assigned sites)
);
```

**INSERT Policy Pattern:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY {table}_insert_{role}_access ON {table}
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  -- Validation condition (e.g., user has role and site access)
);
```

**UPDATE Policy Pattern:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY {table}_update_{role}_access ON {table}
FOR UPDATE
USING (
  -- Access condition (which rows can be updated)
)
WITH CHECK (
  -- Validation condition (what values are allowed)
);
```

**DELETE Policy Pattern:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY {table}_delete_{role}_access ON {table}
FOR DELETE
USING (
  -- Access condition (which rows can be deleted)
);
```

# 3. Core Entity Tables RLS Policies

## 3.1 Companies Table

**Table:** `companies`  
**RLS Enabled:** Yes  
**Soft Delete:** Yes (`deleted_at`)

### SELECT Policy

**Policy:** `companies_select_user_access`

```sql
CREATE POLICY companies_select_user_access ON companies
FOR SELECT
USING (
  deleted_at IS NULL
  AND (
    -- Regular users: their own company
    id = (SELECT company_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
    OR
    -- Consultants: assigned client companies
    id IN (
      SELECT client_company_id FROM consultant_client_assignments
      WHERE consultant_id = auth.uid()
      AND status = 'ACTIVE'
    )
  )
);
```

**Access Logic:**
- Regular users: Can see their own company (via `users.company_id`)
- Consultants: Can see assigned client companies (via `consultant_client_assignments`)
- Soft-deleted companies are excluded

### INSERT Policy

**Policy:** `companies_insert_owner_access`

```sql
CREATE POLICY companies_insert_owner_access ON companies
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'OWNER'
  )
);
```

**Access Logic:**
- Only Owners can create companies
- Typically created during signup (first company)

### UPDATE Policy

**Policy:** `companies_update_owner_admin_access`

```sql
CREATE POLICY companies_update_owner_admin_access ON companies
FOR UPDATE
USING (
  deleted_at IS NULL
  AND (
    -- Regular users: Owner/Admin of their own company
    (
      id = (SELECT company_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
      AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND role IN ('OWNER', 'ADMIN')
      )
    )
    OR
    -- Consultants: assigned client companies (read-only, cannot update)
    FALSE
  )
  -- Explicitly block consultants from updating ANY company fields
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'CONSULTANT'
  )
)
WITH CHECK (
  -- Same condition as USING
  deleted_at IS NULL
  AND (
    id = (SELECT company_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('OWNER', 'ADMIN')
    )
  )
  -- Block consultants from updating settings/subscription fields
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'CONSULTANT'
  )
);
```

**Access Logic:**
- Owners and Admins can update companies they are assigned to
- Consultants CANNOT update companies (read-only access)
- Consultants blocked from updating settings, subscription_tier, billing fields, or any company fields
- Cannot update soft-deleted companies

### DELETE Policy

**Policy:** `companies_delete_owner_access`

```sql
CREATE POLICY companies_delete_owner_access ON companies
FOR DELETE
USING (
  -- Only Owner of their own company can delete
  id = (SELECT company_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    AND role = 'OWNER'
  )
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sites
    WHERE company_id = companies.id
    AND deleted_at IS NULL
  )
);
```

**Access Logic:**
- Only Owners can delete companies
- Cannot delete companies with active sites (business rule)

## 3.2 Sites Table

    company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
    OR id IN (
      SELECT site_id FROM user_site_assignments
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
    OR

    company_id IN (
      SELECT client_company_id FROM consultant_client_assignments
      WHERE consultant_id = auth.uid()

```

**Access Logic:**
- **Board Pack:** Only Owners/Admins can generate (company-level access, site_id = NULL)
- **Other Pack Types:** Owners, Admins, Staff can generate (site-level access)
- **Consultants:** Can generate packs ONLY for assigned clients (strict validation)
  - Must have CONSULTANT role
  - Must have active assignment to client company
  - Site must belong to assigned client company
  - Cannot generate Board Packs (executive-level access required)
  - Pack generation blocked with `403 FORBIDDEN` if client not assigned
- **Rationale:** Board Pack contains company-wide risk data requiring executive-level access
- **Tenant Isolation:** Consultants cannot generate packs for unassigned clients

## 9.3 Special Rules

### Evidence Deletion
- **No role can DELETE evidence items** - Evidence is archived by system after retention period
- This is enforced by having no DELETE policy on `evidence_items` table

### System-Generated Records
- **Deadlines:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from obligations)
- **Exceedances:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from lab results)
- **Escalations:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from overdue items)
- **Review Queue Items:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from AI extraction)
- **Cross-Sell Triggers:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from usage patterns)
- **Obligation Versions:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated on obligation changes)
- **Evidence Completeness Scores:** INSERT/UPDATE by system only (auto-calculated)
- **Evidence Versions:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated on evidence update)
- **Recurring Tasks:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from schedules)
- **Evidence Expiry Tracking:** INSERT/UPDATE by system only (auto-generated from evidence items)
- **Breach Likelihood Scores:** INSERT/UPDATE by system only (auto-calculated)
- **Predictive Breach Alerts:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated)
- **Exposure Calculations:** INSERT/UPDATE by system only (auto-calculated)
- **Reconciliation Discrepancies:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated)
- **Frequency Calculations:** INSERT by system only (auto-calculated)
- **Compliance Clocks:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from generators)
- **Chain Break Alerts:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from chain of custody validation)
- **Validation Results:** INSERT by system only (auto-generated from validation rules)

### Module Activation Requirements
- Module 2/3 entities require module activation check
- Users cannot access Module 2/3 data if module is not activated for their company
- Enforced via RLS policies checking `module_activations` table

### Consultant Restrictions
- Consultants can only access assigned client companies/sites
- Consultants have Staff-level permissions but scoped to clients only
- Enforced via consultant isolation policies

### Viewer Restrictions
- Viewers have read-only access (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies)
- Viewers can see all data within their assigned sites/companies
- No write operations allowed

# 11. Consultant Data Isolation

## 11.1 Consultant Isolation Strategy

Consultants have multi-company access but must be isolated to only their assigned client companies/sites. This is enforced at the database level via RLS policies.

## 11.2 Consultant Assignment

Consultants are assigned to client companies via the `consultant_client_assignments` table:
- `consultant_id` = consultant user ID (must have `role = 'CONSULTANT'` in `user_roles`)
- `client_company_id` = client company ID
- `status` = 'ACTIVE' (active assignment) or 'INACTIVE' (access revoked)

**Note:** Consultants have a primary company via `users.company_id` (their own company), but can access multiple client companies via `consultant_client_assignments`.

## 11.3 Consultant Isolation Policy Pattern

All tables with `company_id` or `site_id` must include consultant isolation check:

```sql
-- Example: Consultant isolation for companies table
CREATE POLICY companies_consultant_isolation ON companies
FOR ALL
USING (
  CASE
    WHEN EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role = 'CONSULTANT'
    )
    THEN
      id IN (
        SELECT client_company_id FROM consultant_client_assignments
        WHERE consultant_id = auth.uid()
        AND status = 'ACTIVE'
      )
    ELSE TRUE
  END
);
```

## 11.4 Consultant Access Logic

**Function:** `is_consultant_assigned_to_company`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_consultant_assigned_to_company(
  consultant_id UUID,
  company_id UUID
)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM consultant_client_assignments
    WHERE consultant_id = is_consultant_assigned_to_company.consultant_id
    AND client_company_id = is_consultant_assigned_to_company.company_id
    AND status = 'ACTIVE'
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## 11.5 Consultant Restrictions

**Access Restrictions:**
- **Upload Restrictions:** Consultants can only upload documents/evidence to assigned client companies/sites
- **Settings Access:** Consultants CANNOT access company settings or subscription management
  - No SELECT/UPDATE access to `companies` table for settings fields (billing, subscription_tier, etc.)
  - No access to subscription/billing endpoints
  - Settings navigation hidden in UI for consultant role
- **Subscription Management:** Consultants CANNOT view or modify subscription/billing information
  - No access to billing history, payment methods, or subscription changes
  - Subscription endpoints return `403 FORBIDDEN` for consultant role

**Cross-Client Prohibition (Tenant Isolation):**
- **View Data:** Consultants cannot view data from unassigned clients
- **Upload Documents:** Consultants cannot upload documents to unassigned clients
- **Evidence Isolation:** Evidence cannot leak across clients - strict tenant isolation enforced:
  - Evidence items can only be linked to obligations within the same client company
  - Evidence uploads are scoped to assigned client sites only
  - Cross-client evidence linking is blocked at RLS level
  - Evidence queries filtered by `company_id IN (SELECT client_company_id FROM consultant_client_assignments WHERE consultant_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'ACTIVE')`
- **Pack Generation:** Consultants can only generate audit packs for assigned clients
  - Pack generation validates `company_id` against `consultant_client_assignments`
  - All pack types (Regulator, Tender, Board, Insurer, Audit) restricted to assigned clients only
  - Pack generation blocked with `403 FORBIDDEN` if client not assigned

**Multi-Site Access:**
- Consultants can view multiple assigned sites across different client companies
- Site access determined by `consultant_client_assignments.client_company_id`
- All sites within assigned client companies are accessible
- Site switcher in UI shows all assigned client sites grouped by company

> [v1 UPDATE – Pack Access Policies – 2024-12-27]

# 13. v1.0 Pack Access Policies

## 13.1 Pack Type Access Control

**Plan-Based Access:**
- Core Plan: `REGULATOR_INSPECTION`, `AUDIT_PACK` only
- Growth Plan: All pack types
- Consultant Edition: All pack types (for assigned clients)

**Enforcement:** Application-level (plan check) + RLS (site/company access)

## 13.2 Pack Generation Access

**Updated Policy:** `audit_packs_insert_staff_access` (extends existing policy)

> **Note:** This policy is superseded by the updated policy in Section 11.2 above, which includes Board Pack exceptions. This section is kept for reference but the policy in Section 11.2 is authoritative.

**Access Logic:**
- **Board Pack:** Only Owners/Admins can generate (company-level access, site_id = NULL)
- **Other Pack Types:** Owners, Admins, Staff can generate (site-level access)
- **Consultants:** Can generate packs for assigned clients (site-level access, not Board Pack)
- Pack type access validated at API level based on user plan

## 13.3 Pack View Access

**Policy:** `audit_packs_select_site_access` (existing, no changes)

**Pack Type Filtering:**
- All users can view packs from their assigned sites
- Pack type visibility not restricted (users see all pack types they have access to generate)

## 13.4 Board Pack Multi-Site Access

**Special Case:** Board Pack requires `company_id` scope (not `site_id`)

**Policy:** `audit_packs_select_board_pack_access`

```sql
CREATE POLICY audit_packs_select_board_pack_access ON audit_packs
FOR SELECT
USING (
  (
    pack_type = 'BOARD_MULTI_SITE_RISK'
    AND (
      -- Regular users: Owner/Admin of their own company
      company_id = (SELECT company_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())
      AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND role IN ('OWNER', 'ADMIN')
      )
      OR
      -- Consultants: assigned client companies
      company_id IN (
        SELECT client_company_id FROM consultant_client_assignments
        WHERE consultant_id = auth.uid()
        AND status = 'ACTIVE'
      )
      AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND role = 'CONSULTANT'
      )
    )
  )
  OR (
    pack_type != 'BOARD_MULTI_SITE_RISK'
    AND site_id IN (
      SELECT site_id FROM user_site_assignments
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  )
);
```

**Access Logic:**
- Board Packs: Only Owners/Admins of company can view
- Other Packs: Standard site-based access

**Reference:** Product Logic Specification Section I.8.4 (Board/Multi-Site Risk Pack Logic)

> [v1 UPDATE – Pack Distribution Policies – 2024-12-27]

# 14. v1.0 Pack Distribution Policies

> [v1.6 UPDATE – Pack Distributions Table Removed – 2025-01-01]
> - Removed `pack_distributions` table RLS policies
> - Pack distribution functionality merged into `pack_sharing` table
> - See `pack_sharing` table RLS policies (Section 9.4) for consolidated distribution access control

## 14.1 pack_sharing Table (Consolidated Distribution)

> [v1.6 UPDATE – Pack Distributions Table Removed – 2025-01-01]
> - Removed `pack_distributions` table RLS policies
> - Pack distribution functionality merged into `pack_sharing` table
> - See `pack_sharing` table RLS policies (Section 9.4) for consolidated distribution access control

## 14.2 Shared Link Access

**Policy:** `audit_packs_select_shared_link_access`

```sql
CREATE POLICY audit_packs_select_shared_link_access ON audit_packs
FOR SELECT
USING (
  -- Standard site access
  site_id IN (
    SELECT site_id FROM user_site_assignments
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  )
  OR
  -- Shared link access (no authentication required if token valid)
  (
    shared_link_token IS NOT NULL
    AND shared_link_expires_at > NOW()
    -- Token validation happens at application level
  )
);
```

**Access Logic:**
- Shared links bypass standard RLS (token-based access)
- Token validation and expiration checked at application level
- Shared link access logged in `pack_sharing` table

**Reference:** Product Logic Specification Section I.8.7 (Pack Distribution Logic)

# 15. Service Role Handling

## 15.1 Service Role vs User JWT

### Service Role Usage

**When to Use Service Role:**
- Background jobs (document processing, Excel import, monitoring schedules)
- Admin operations (system maintenance, bulk operations)
- Cross-tenant operations (if needed)
- Migration scripts

**Service Role Bypass:**
- Service role JWT bypasses RLS policies
- Use `auth.role() = 'service_role'` check in policies
- Service role should still respect business logic constraints

### User JWT Usage

**When to Use User JWT:**
- User-facing API requests
- Real-time subscriptions
- User-initiated operations
- Onboarding flows

**User JWT RLS Enforcement:**
- All RLS policies apply to user JWT
- Policies check `auth.uid()` for user identity
- Policies check `user_roles` and `user_site_assignments` for access

## 15.2 Service Role Policy Pattern

```sql
-- Example: System-only INSERT policy
CREATE POLICY {table}_insert_system_access ON {table}
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

---

# 16. Edge Cases & Special Scenarios

## 16.1 Soft Delete Handling

### RLS Policy Pattern for Soft Deletes

```sql
-- Add deleted_at check to all SELECT policies
CREATE POLICY {table}_select_{scope} ON {table}
FOR SELECT
USING (
  deleted_at IS NULL
  AND (
    -- Existing access conditions
  )
);
```

### Who Can See Soft-Deleted Records

- Only Owner/Admin can see soft-deleted records (for restore purposes)
- Add separate policy: `{table}_select_deleted_owner_admin`

### Who Can Restore

- Only Owner/Admin can restore soft-deleted records
- UPDATE policy: `{table}_update_deleted_owner_admin` (sets `deleted_at = NULL`)

### Who Can Permanently Delete

- Only Owner can permanently delete (hard delete)
- Requires separate DELETE policy with `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` check

## 16.2 Nested Resource Access

### Access via Parent Resource

- Obligations accessed via documents: Check `document.site_id` in obligation policy
- Evidence accessed via obligations: Check `obligation.site_id` in evidence policy
- Schedules accessed via obligations: Check `obligation.site_id` in schedule policy

### RLS Policy Pattern

```sql
-- Obligations accessible via document relationship
CREATE POLICY obligations_select_via_document ON obligations
FOR SELECT
USING (
  deleted_at IS NULL
  AND document_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM documents
    WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
    AND site_id IN (
      SELECT site_id FROM user_site_assignments
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  )
);
```

## 16.3 Module-Specific Permissions

### Module Activation Check

- Add module activation check to Module 2/3 table policies
- Pattern: `AND is_module_activated(company_id, module_id)`

### RLS Policy Pattern

```sql
CREATE POLICY parameters_select_site_module ON parameters
FOR SELECT
USING (
  site_id IN (
    SELECT site_id FROM user_site_assignments
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  )
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM module_activations
    WHERE company_id = parameters.company_id
    AND module_id = parameters.module_id
    AND status = 'ACTIVE'
  )
);
```

## 16.4 Time-Based Permissions

### Historical Data Access

- No time restrictions on historical data
- Users can access all historical records (within site/company access)

### Future-Dated Records

- No restrictions on future-dated records
- Users can create obligations with future deadlines

## 16.5 Bulk Operations

### Bulk Create

- Same RLS policies apply to bulk INSERT
- Each row checked individually against RLS policies
- Partial success: Some rows succeed, some fail (based on RLS)

### Bulk Update

- Same RLS policies apply to bulk UPDATE
- Each row checked individually against RLS policies

### Bulk Delete

- Same RLS policies apply to bulk DELETE
- Each row checked individually against RLS policies

---

# 17. Performance Considerations

## 17.1 Index Requirements

### Required Indexes for RLS Performance

```sql
-- Indexes for user_roles lookups
-- Indexes for user_roles lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_user_id_role ON user_roles(user_id, role);

-- Indexes for user_site_assignments lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_site_assignments_user_id_site_id ON user_site_assignments(user_id, site_id);

-- Indexes for consultant_client_assignments lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_consultant_client_assignments_consultant_id ON consultant_client_assignments(consultant_id) WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';
CREATE INDEX idx_consultant_client_assignments_client_company_id ON consultant_client_assignments(client_company_id) WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';

-- Indexes for module_activations lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_module_activations_company_id_module_id ON module_activations(company_id, module_id) WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';

-- Indexes for company_id and site_id on all tables
CREATE INDEX idx_{table}_company_id ON {table}(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_{table}_site_id ON {table}(site_id);
```

## 17.2 Query Optimization

### RLS Policy Optimization

- Use EXISTS subqueries (faster than IN subqueries)
- Use indexed columns in policy conditions
- Avoid complex joins in policy conditions
- Cache permission checks where possible

## 17.3 Caching Strategy

### Permission Check Caching

- Cache company access checks (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Cache site access checks (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Cache role checks (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Invalidate cache on role/site assignment changes

---

# 18. RLS Policy Deployment

## 18.1 Migration Strategy

### Migration File Structure

```
migrations/
├── 001_enable_rls_on_tables.sql
├── 002_create_rls_policies_core.sql
├── 003_create_rls_policies_module2.sql
├── 004_create_rls_policies_module3.sql
├── 005_create_rls_policies_cross_module.sql
├── 006_create_permission_functions.sql
└── 007_create_rls_indexes.sql
```

### Migration Steps

1. Enable RLS on all tables: `ALTER TABLE {table} ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
2. Create RLS policies for each table (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
3. Create permission check functions
4. Create indexes for RLS policy performance
5. Test policies in staging environment
6. Deploy to production

## 18.2 Policy Versioning

### Version Tracking

- Track policy changes in `policy_versions` table
- Include policy name, version, SQL, created_at, created_by
- Rollback to previous version if needed

## 18.3 Policy Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Steps

1. Identify problematic policy
2. Disable policy: `DROP POLICY {policy_name} ON {table};`
3. Restore previous version from `policy_versions` table
4. Re-create policy from previous version
5. Test rollback in staging
6. Deploy rollback to production

## 18.4 Policy Testing

### Unit Tests

- Test each RLS policy individually
- Test with different user roles
- Test with different data scenarios

### Integration Tests

- Test RLS policies with API endpoints
- Test RLS policies with background jobs
- Test RLS policies with real-time subscriptions

### Performance Tests

- Measure RLS overhead (query time with/without RLS)
- Test with large datasets (10,000+ rows)
- Test with complex joins
- Benchmark: RLS should add < 50ms overhead per query

- **RLS Policy:** `companies_select_user_access`

### Test Case 3: Viewer cannot create obligations
- **Setup:** Create viewer user, assign to site
- **Test:** Viewer attempts to INSERT obligation
- **Expected:** Returns 403 Forbidden (no INSERT policy for viewer)
- **RLS Policy:** No INSERT policy for viewer role

### Test Case 4: Consultant can only access assigned clients
- **Setup:** Create consultant user, create two companies, assign consultant to company A only
- **Test:** Consultant queries company B data

- **Test:** Staff attempts to DELETE obligation
- **Expected:** Returns 403 Forbidden (no DELETE policy for staff)
- **RLS Policy:** No DELETE policy for staff role

### Test Case 6: Evidence cannot be deleted by any role
- **Setup:** Create owner user, assign to site, create evidence
- **Test:** Owner attempts to DELETE evidence
- **Expected:** Returns 403 Forbidden (no DELETE policy for any role)
- **RLS Policy:** No DELETE policy (system archives only)

### Test Case 7: Module 2 data requires module activation
- **Setup:** Create owner user, assign to site, Module 2 not activated
- **Test:** Owner attempts to INSERT parameter
- **Expected:** Returns 403 Forbidden (module not activated)
- **RLS Policy:** `parameters_insert_staff_module` (checks module activation)

## 19.2 Test Cases for Edge Cases

### Test Case 8: Soft-deleted records access
- **Setup:** Create owner user, create company, soft-delete company
- **Test:** Owner queries soft-deleted company
- **Expected:** Returns empty result (RLS filters soft-deleted)
- **RLS Policy:** Add `AND deleted_at IS NULL` condition

### Test Case 9: Service role bypasses RLS
- **Setup:** Use service role JWT (not user JWT)
- **Test:** Service role queries any data
- **Expected:** Returns all data (RLS bypassed for service role)
- **RLS Policy:** Check `auth.role() = 'service_role'`

## 19.3 Performance Test Cases

### Test Case 10: RLS policy performance with large dataset
- **Setup:** Create 10,000 obligations across 100 sites, assign user to 10 sites
- **Test:** User queries obligations
- **Expected:** Returns only 1,000 obligations (10 sites), query completes in < 500ms
- **RLS Policy:** Requires indexes on `site_id`, `user_site_assignments`
