# Documentation Readiness Checklist
## How to Know When Your Docs Are Ready for Development

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-27
**Status:** Living Document

---

## Executive Summary

Your documentation is ready for development when you can answer **YES** to all items in Section 1 (Critical), and **YES** to at least 90% of items in Section 2 (Essential).

**Current Status Based on Hostile Review:**
- ✅ **Architecture:** 85% ready (good structure, clear design)
- ❌ **Technical Accuracy:** 0% ready (invalid AI model references)
- ⚠️ **Consistency:** 60% ready (terminology inconsistencies, status contradictions)
- ⚠️ **Completeness:** 70% ready (most features documented, some gaps)

**Overall Readiness:** 35% - **NOT READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**

---

## Section 1: CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before ANY Development)

### ❌ 1.1 Invalid Technical References
**Status:** BLOCKED - System would fail immediately

**The Problem:**
- 82 references to `gpt-4o` (model doesn't exist)
- 22 references to `gpt-4o-mini` (model doesn't exist)
- Affects 7 core documents

**How to Fix:**
```bash
# Replace all invalid model references
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/gpt-4\.1/gpt-4o/g' {} +
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/gpt-4\.1-mini/gpt-4o-mini/g' {} +
```

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Should return 0 results
grep -r "gpt-4\.1" *.md | wc -l
```

**Decision Required:**
Which OpenAI model will you actually use?
- `gpt-4o` ($5/1M input, $15/1M output) - Recommended for production
- `gpt-4-turbo` ($10/1M input, $30/1M output) - Better accuracy
- `gpt-4o-mini` ($0.15/1M input, $0.60/1M output) - For testing/preview

---

### ❌ 1.2 CHANGELOG Status Claims Are False
**Status:** BLOCKED - Misleading stakeholders

**The Problem:**
- CHANGELOG claims "18 documents complete"
- Actually lists only 6 as complete
- 12 listed as "Pending" but have "Status: Complete" in their headers

**How to Fix:**
1. Audit each document manually
2. Decide on TRUE status for each
3. Update CHANGELOG.md lines 264-287

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Count documents marked "Complete" in headers
grep -l "^Status: Complete" *.md | wc -l

# Count documents marked complete in CHANGELOG
grep "✅" CHANGELOG.md | grep -c "Complete"

# These numbers should match
```

**Documents with Status Contradictions:**
| Document | Header Says | CHANGELOG Says | TRUE STATUS? |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| EP_Compliance_RLS_Permissions_Rules.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |
| EP_Compliance_Background_Jobs_Specification.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |
| EP_Compliance_Technical_Architecture_Stack.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |
| EP_Compliance_User_Workflow_Maps.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |
| EP_Compliance_Testing_QA_Strategy.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |
| EP_Compliance_UI_UX_Design_System.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |
| EP_Compliance_Frontend_Routes_Component_Map.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |
| EP_Compliance_Notification_Messaging_Specification.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |
| EP_Compliance_Onboarding_Flow_Specification.md | Complete | Pending | ??? |

**You must decide:** Are these complete or not?

---

### ⚠️ 1.3 Pack Type Backward Compatibility Undefined
**Status:** CAUTION - Will cause runtime errors if not clarified

**The Problem:**
- Canonical_Dictionary says "MODULE_1, MODULE_2, MODULE_3 pack types removed"
- But also says "COMBINED remains for backward compatibility"
- No migration strategy documented
- Database schema still has MODULE_1/2/3 in sample data

**How to Fix:**
Add to Canonical_Dictionary.md (Section D.10):

```markdown
### Pack Type Migration Strategy

**Legacy Pack Types (Pre-v1.0):**
- `MODULE_1`, `MODULE_2`, `MODULE_3` - Deprecated

**Migration Behavior:**
- Existing packs with legacy types: READ-ONLY (preserved for historical data)
- New pack generation: Must use v1.0 pack types only
- No automatic migration required
- Legacy packs remain queryable but cannot be regenerated

**Validation Rules:**
- New pack generation API rejects legacy pack types
- Frontend UI only shows v1.0 pack types in dropdown
- Database CHECK constraint: Allow legacy types for backward compatibility, validate at application layer
```

**Verification Test:**
Can you answer these questions?
- ✅ Can the system read old MODULE_1 packs? (Yes/No)
- ✅ Can the system create new MODULE_1 packs? (Yes/No)
- ✅ What happens if user tries to create MODULE_1 pack? (Error message?)
- ✅ Are legacy packs migrated automatically or manually? (Auto/Manual/Never)

---

## Section 2: ESSENTIAL CONSISTENCY CHECKS (Fix Before Building)

### ⚠️ 2.1 Pricing Model Consistency
**Status:** NEEDS VERIFICATION

**What to Check:**
All documents should reference the same pricing model.

**The Source of Truth:**
- Core Plan: £149/month (1 site, 1 permit, Module 1 only)
- Growth Plan: £249/month (Core + all pack types)
- Consultant Edition: £299/month (Growth + multi-client access)
- Add-ons: +£49/permit, +£99/site, +£59/module 2, +£79/module 3

**Verification Command:**
```bash
# Extract all pricing references
grep -rn "£[0-9]\+" *.md | grep -E "month|plan|pricing" > pricing_audit.txt

# Manually review for inconsistencies
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ All documents reference £149/£249/£299 consistently
- ✅ All add-on prices match (£49, £99, £59, £79)
- ✅ No contradictory pricing found

---

### ⚠️ 2.2 Terminology Consistency
**Status:** NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (75/100)

**Common Inconsistencies Found:**
| Inconsistent Term | Correct Usage | Search/Replace |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| pack / Pack / PACK | Use "pack" in code, "Pack" in UI labels | Manual review |
| consultant / Consultant user | Use "consultant" consistently | `s/consultant user/consultant/g` |
| client company / client / customer | Use "client company" consistently | `s/customer company/client company/g` |
| module_code / module_type | Use "module_code" consistently | Check all code references |

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Check for mixed capitalization of "pack"
grep -rn "\bPack\b" *.md | grep -v "# .*Pack" | wc -l  # UI labels OK
grep -rn "\bpack\b" *.md | grep "Pack:" | wc -l  # Inconsistencies

# Check for "consultant user" vs "consultant"
grep -rn "consultant user" *.md

# Check for "customer" when should be "client"
grep -rn "\bcustomer\b" *.md | grep -v "customer acquisition\|customer journey"
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Terminology used consistently across all documents
- ✅ Canonical_Dictionary.md defines ONE canonical term for each concept
- ✅ All documents follow Canonical_Dictionary

---

### ✅ 2.3 Database Schema ↔ API Specification Alignment
**Status:** CANNOT FULLY VERIFY (File too large)

**What to Check:**
Every database table should have corresponding API endpoints.

**Manual Verification Required:**
1. List all tables from Database_Schema.md
2. List all endpoints from Backend_API_Specification.md
3. Create mapping table

**Example Check:**
```markdown
| Table | Endpoint | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| audit_packs | POST /api/v1/packs | ✅ Aligned |
| audit_packs | GET /api/v1/packs/{id} | ✅ Aligned |
| consultant_client_assignments | GET /api/v1/consultant/clients | ??? |
| consultant_client_assignments | POST /api/v1/consultant/clients/{id}/assign | ??? |
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ All core tables have CRUD endpoints
- ✅ All endpoint request/response schemas match database columns
- ✅ All foreign keys have corresponding nested/expanded responses

---

### ⚠️ 2.4 RLS Policies ↔ Product Logic Alignment
**Status:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED

**What to Check:**
Every permission rule in Product Logic should have an RLS policy.

**Test Case Example:**
**Product Logic says:** "Consultants can only access assigned client companies"
**RLS Policy should have:** `consultant_client_assignments` table join in WHERE clause

**Verification Found:**
- ✅ Consultant role defined in RLS (CONSULTANT in role enum)
- ✅ Consultant access uses `consultant_client_assignments` table
- ⚠️ Need to verify ALL consultant permissions have RLS policies

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Every user role has defined RLS policies
- ✅ Every "access rule" in Product Logic has corresponding RLS policy
- ✅ Consultant multi-client access fully implemented in RLS

---

### ⚠️ 2.5 Feature Inventory Completeness
**Status:** UNVERIFIABLE (Cannot count 177 features easily)

**The Claim:**
FEATURE_INVENTORY_AND_REFERENCES.md claims 177 features documented.

**The Problem:**
Features numbered hierarchically (1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.) making count verification difficult.

**How to Fix:**
Add explicit feature count to end of each section:

```markdown
### Module 1: Environmental Permits
- 1.1.1 Document Upload
- 1.1.2 PDF Processing
- 1.1.3 OCR Extraction
...
**Subtotal: 87 features**

### Module 2: Trade Effluent
...
**Subtotal: 45 features**

### Module 3: MCPD
...
**Subtotal: 45 features**

**GRAND TOTAL: 177 features**
```

**Verification Test:**
```bash
# Count feature lines (must return 177)
grep -E "^- [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ " FEATURE_INVENTORY_AND_REFERENCES.md | wc -l
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Feature count is verifiable with simple grep
- ✅ All 177 features have document references
- ✅ No features missing implementation specs

---

## Section 3: NICE-TO-HAVE IMPROVEMENTS (Can Build Without These)

### 🔸 3.1 Cross-Reference Completeness
**Issue:** Many "See Section X" references don't specify which document

**How to Fix:**
Replace: `See Section I.8`
With: `See Product Logic Specification Section I.8`

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ All cross-references include document name
- ✅ All cross-references point to existing sections

---

### 🔸 3.2 Formatting Consistency
**Issues Found:**
- Date formats mixed (2024-12-27 vs. December 27, 2024)
- Enum naming not always UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Code blocks missing language tags
- Inconsistent list formatting (- vs. * vs. 1.)

**How to Fix:**
Create STYLE_GUIDE.md with rules:
- Dates: Always YYYY-MM-DD
- Enums: Always UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Code blocks: Always specify language
- Lists: Use - for unordered, 1. for ordered

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ All documents follow same style guide
- ✅ Formatting is consistent across all documents

---

### 🔸 3.3 Document Dependency Graph
**Nice to Have:**
Create visual diagram showing which documents depend on which.

**Example:**
```
Master_Plan.md (no dependencies)
    ↓
Product_Logic_Specification.md (depends on Master_Plan)
    ↓
Database_Schema.md (depends on Product_Logic)
    ↓
Backend_API_Specification.md (depends on Database_Schema)
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- ✅ Dependency graph exists
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ All dependencies are up-to-date

---
