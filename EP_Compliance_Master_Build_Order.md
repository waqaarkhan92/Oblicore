## 🔄 **CRITICAL ORDER CORRECTION**

**Product Logic Specification (PLS) must be generated BEFORE Canonical Dictionary.**

**Why:** The MCP is commercial/strategic, not functionally detailed. To create an accurate, complete Canonical Dictionary (with all entities, tables, fields, enums, and statuses), Claude needs the functional workflows, rules, behaviors, and edge cases defined in the PLS first. Without the PLS, the Canonical Dictionary will be incomplete or require guesswork.

**Correct Sequence:**
1. MCP (commercial vision)
2. **Product Logic Specification** (functional rules, workflows, behaviors)
3. **Canonical Dictionary** (entities, tables, naming, enums - derived from PLS)
4. All subsequent documents

## **1.1 Product Logic Specification (PLS)** 📝

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Created by:** Claude  
**Depends on:** MCP (0.1)

**Document Format:**
- Markdown format with clear sections and subsections
- Use examples, scenarios, and step-by-step flows where helpful
- Be specific and detailed—this is the functional blueprint
- Write at a functional level (what happens, when, why) not a technical level (how it's coded)

**What Claude Must Create:**

This document expands the MCP into complete functional detail. It must define:

1. **Obligations → Evidence → Deadlines → Audit Packs:** Complete data flow logic
   - How obligations are created from permits
   - How evidence links to obligations
   - How deadlines are calculated (from what date, what frequency)
   - How audit packs compile evidence
   - What happens at each step

2. **AI extraction behaviour:** 
   - When LLM extracts automatically vs. when it flags for review
   - Confidence thresholds (e.g., >85% = auto-extract, <85% = flag)
   - What triggers human review
   - How extraction errors are handled

3. **Module routing logic:** 
   - How system determines which module handles which document type (configurable via `modules` table)
   - Module routing is dynamic (based on `modules.document_types` JSONB field)
   - Cross-module rule interactions

4. **Human-required review points:** 
   - Subjective obligations (how identified, what happens)
   - Low-confidence extractions (threshold, workflow)
   - Edge cases (what are they, how handled)

5. **Module switching logic:** 
   - How Module 2/3 activate (triggers, prerequisites)
   - Cross-sell trigger detection (what keywords, what actions)
   - User activation vs. automatic detection

6. **Cross-module dependencies:** 
   - Module prerequisites (how modules.requires_module_id enforces prerequisites dynamically)
   - Prerequisite chains (how modules can have multiple levels of prerequisites)
   - What happens if user tries to activate without prerequisite (system queries modules table to check)

7. **How the LLM should process each document type:**
   - EA permits: Extract standard conditions, identify monitoring frequencies, detect deadlines
   - Trade effluent consents: Extract parameter limits, identify sampling frequencies, detect exceedance thresholds
   - MCPD registrations: Extract run-hour limits, identify reporting requirements, detect generator types
   - Step-by-step processing workflow for each

8. **The exact workflow for AI pattern matching:** 
   - Rule library lookup → LLM extraction → Confidence scoring → Human review flagging
   - What happens at each stage
   - Error handling at each stage

9. **Feature-by-feature logic:** 
   - How each feature works functionally (not technically)
   - What inputs, what outputs, what validations
   - For each major feature: permit upload, extraction, evidence linking, scheduling, audit packs, etc.
   - **Excel import logic:** How users can import existing permit/obligation data from Excel/CSV files
     - Excel import as alternative to PDF upload (for users with existing spreadsheets)
     - Excel file format requirements (.xlsx, .xls, CSV)
     - Required columns: permit_number, permit_type, obligation_title, obligation_description, frequency, deadline_date, site_id
     - Optional columns: evidence_linked, notes, regulator, permit_date
     - Column mapping logic (how Excel columns map to database fields)
     - Validation rules (required fields, date formats, frequency values)
     - Error handling (invalid rows, missing required fields, duplicate detection)
     - Bulk import processing (create multiple obligations from single Excel file)
     - Import source tracking (mark obligations as imported from Excel vs extracted from PDF)
     - Import preview (show what will be imported before confirmation)
     - Import completion notification (success count, error count, error details)

10. **Rules for extraction:** 
    - What gets extracted automatically
    - What gets flagged for review
    - What requires human confirmation
    - Examples of each

11. **Rules for subjective flags:** 
   - When obligations are marked as subjective
   - Why (what patterns trigger this)
   - Interpretation locking and history (immutable audit trail - see PLS Section A.6.1)
    - What happens next (workflow)

12. **Monitoring logic:** 
   - How monitoring schedules work
   - How deadlines are calculated (from permit date? from last completion?)
   - Recurring vs. one-time obligations
   - How schedules are customized
   - Schedule modifications logged with audit trail (modified_by, modified_at, previous_values - see PLS Section B.7.3)

13. **Evidence logic:** 
   - How evidence links to obligations (one-to-one? one-to-many?)
   - What evidence types are valid (photos, PDFs, CSVs, etc.)
   - Evidence validation rules
   - Evidence expiry/retention rules
   - Evidence enforcement rule (7-day grace period, escalation logic - see PLS Section B.4.1.1)
   - Document size limits (200 pages max, 10 images per page, 150-600 DPI resolution - see PLS Section B.1.1)

14. **Excel import logic:**
   - **Import methods:** Excel import as alternative to PDF upload for users with existing permit/obligation data
   - **Supported formats:** .xlsx, .xls, CSV (comma-separated values)
   - **File size limits:** 10MB max per Excel file, 10,000 rows max per file
   - **Required columns:** permit_number (or permit_id), obligation_title, obligation_description, frequency, deadline_date (or next_deadline), site_id (or site_name)
   - **Optional columns:** permit_type, permit_date, regulator, evidence_linked, evidence_file_path, notes, category, status
   - **Column mapping:** Flexible column mapping (user can map Excel columns to system fields)
   - **Data validation:** 
     - Date format validation (accepts multiple formats: DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD)
     - Frequency validation (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, one-time)
     - Site validation (site_id must exist, or site_name will be matched/created)
     - Permit validation (permit_number must be unique per site, or will create new permit)
   - **Duplicate detection:** Check for duplicate obligations (same permit_number + obligation_title + site_id)
   - **Bulk processing:** Process all valid rows, skip invalid rows with error reporting
   - **Import preview:** Show preview of what will be imported (obligations count, sites affected, errors)
   - **Import confirmation:** User confirms import after preview, can edit/correct errors before importing
   - **Import source tracking:** Mark obligations with `import_source: 'excel'` vs `import_source: 'pdf_extraction'` vs `import_source: 'manual'`
   - **Error handling:** 
     - Invalid rows: Skip row, report error with row number and reason
     - Missing required fields: Skip row, report missing field
     - Invalid date formats: Attempt to parse, report if unparseable
     - Invalid frequency values: Report error, suggest valid values
   - **Post-import:** 
     - Create obligations from valid rows
     - Link to permits (create permit if permit_number doesn't exist)
     - Create sites if site_name doesn't exist (with user confirmation)
     - Send import completion notification (success count, error count, error details)
   - **Onboarding integration:** Excel import option during onboarding (alternative to PDF upload)

15. **Audit pack logic:** 
   - How audit packs are compiled
   - What evidence is included (all? filtered?)
   - Format and structure
   - Reference integrity rules (how deleted/archived evidence/obligations are handled during generation - see PLS Section B.8.3)
    - Generation triggers

16. **Module 2 logic:** 
    - Trade effluent workflows (consent upload → parameter extraction → tracking)
    - Parameter tracking (how values are stored, compared, alerted)
    - Exceedance detection (80% threshold, 100% breach logic)
    - Water company report generation

16. **Module 3 logic:**

    - AER generation (data collection, auto-population, submission)

17. **Cross-module flows:** 
    - How modules interact
    - How cross-sell triggers work (detection, notification, activation)
    - Data sharing between modules

18. **Manual override rules:** 
    - When users can override AI extractions
    - How (what UI, what validation)
    - What happens to overridden data

19. **User-level workflows:** 
    - Step-by-step user journeys for each feature
    - What user sees, what actions available, what happens next
    - Decision points and branches

20. **Edge cases:** 
    - Unusual scenarios (multiple permits per site, permit variations, expired permits, etc.)
    - How each is handled
    - Error states

21. **Failure modes:** 
   - What happens when extraction fails
   - What happens when deadlines are missed
   - What happens when evidence is missing
   - Recovery workflows
   - Background job failures (retry logic, DLQ processing - see PLS Section B.7.4)

22. **What the AI is allowed to do and NOT allowed to do:** 
    - Clear boundaries for AI behavior
    - What AI can decide automatically
    - What requires human judgment
    - Regulatory compliance boundaries

**Purpose:**
This document expands the MCP into functional detail. It bridges the gap between the commercial/strategic MCP and the technical Canonical Dictionary. Without this, Claude cannot produce a complete, accurate canonical dictionary without guessing or hallucinating.

**Critical:** This document must be comprehensive and detailed enough that Claude can derive ALL entities, tables, fields, enums, and statuses for the Canonical Dictionary without any guesswork.

## **1.5a AI Layer Design & Cost Optimization** 📝

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Created by:** Claude  
**Depends on:**
→ Product Logic Specification (1.1)
→ Canonical Dictionary (1.2)
→ *Note: Model selection decision (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 Mini) and pricing are documented in this document itself*

**Note:** User Workflow Maps (1.3) and MCP are NOT needed. This document is about technical AI integration (prompts, API calls, cost optimization), not user experience flows or business strategy. The PLS contains all functional requirements needed.

**Document Format:**
- Markdown with clear sections
- Include code examples (prompt templates, JSON schemas)
- Include cost calculations and estimates
- Be specific and actionable
- Target: 8,000-12,000 words (concise but complete)

**What Claude Must Create:**

This document defines the AI integration layer design, cost optimization strategies, and prompt engineering for OpenAI API integration. It must define:

1. **Model Selection & Strategy:**
   - Primary model: GPT-4.1 (1M token context, $2/$8 per 1M tokens)
   - Secondary model: GPT-4.1 Mini (1M token context, $0.40/$1.60 per 1M tokens)
   - When to use which model (extraction vs simple tasks)
   - Fine-tuning strategy (future consideration)
   - Cost justification (documented in this document)

2. **Token Optimization Strategies:**
   - GPT-4.1's 1M token context = process full documents (no segmentation for most)
   - Only segment if document >800k tokens (very rare, max 500k per segment)
   - Prompt compression techniques (remove redundancy, use 3-4 few-shot examples)
   - Response format optimization (JSON mode, minimize output tokens)

3. **Cost Control Mechanisms:**
   - Rule library first strategy (always check library before API call)
   - Target rule library hit rate (>60% to avoid API calls)
   - Retry limits (max 2 retries per document)
   - Timeout management (30 seconds per API call)
   - Rate limit management (queuing, exponential backoff)
   - Parallel processing (concurrent documents within rate limits)
   - Caching strategies (cache rule matches, cache identical segments)
   - Cost monitoring & alerts (budget thresholds)

4. **Prompt Engineering:**
   - System message templates (<500 tokens, concise, directive)
   - User message templates (with placeholders)
   - Few-shot examples (3-4 examples per prompt type - concise but complete)
   - JSON schema definitions (exact output format)
   - Error handling instructions in prompts
   - 5 prompt templates: Permit Extraction, Parameter Extraction, Run-Hour Extraction, Subjective Detection, Confidence Scoring

5. **Extraction Workflow:**
   - Optimized step-by-step extraction pipeline (using GPT-4.1's 1M token context)
   - Primary flow: Process entire document in one call (if <800k tokens)
   - Fallback: Segment only if document >800k tokens (very rare)
   - Rule library lookup before API call (≥90% match = skip API)
   - Parallel processing strategy (concurrent documents within rate limits)
   - Rate limit management (queuing, exponential backoff)
   - Error recovery flows (retries, fallbacks, manual review flags)

6. **Cost Tracking & Analytics:**
   - Database schema additions for cost tracking:
     - `extraction_logs.input_tokens`
     - `extraction_logs.output_tokens`
     - `extraction_logs.estimated_cost`
     - `extraction_logs.rule_library_hits`
     - `extraction_logs.api_calls_made`
   - Analytics queries (cost per document, cost per module, rule library effectiveness)
   - Cost optimization metrics (targets and KPIs)

7. **Cost Estimates:**
   - Average cost per permit extraction (GPT-4.1): ~$0.14 per document
   - Average cost per task (GPT-4.1 Mini): ~$0.028 per task
   - Cost with rule library (60% hit rate): ~$5.60/month for 100 documents
   - Cost without rule library (100% API calls): ~$14/month for 100 documents
   - Cost savings from GPT-4.1's 1M context: Eliminates segmentation overhead
   - Monthly cost projections: 50/200/500 customers scaling scenarios
   - Pricing verified as of November 2025 (note to verify before implementation)

8. **Integration Points:**
   - How prompts feed into API calls
   - How responses are validated and transformed
   - How errors are handled and logged
   - How costs are tracked in extraction_logs
   - How rule library integrates with API calls
   - How background jobs process extractions

**Cost Optimization Targets:**
- Rule Library Hit Rate: >60% (avoids API calls)
- Average Tokens per Extraction: <60,000 total (but GPT-4.1 can handle up to 1M tokens)
- Cost per Permit: <$1.00 (with rule library) - actual: ~$0.14 with GPT-4.1
- Retry Rate: <5%
- Manual Mode Rate: <2%
- Monthly Cost: ~$5.60/month for 100 documents (with 60% rule library hit rate)

**Purpose:**
This document ensures the AI layer is cost-optimized and well-designed before generating prompts and rules library. It defines exact model selection (GPT-4.1), token optimization (1M context), cost control, and prompt templates that will be used in subsequent documents.

**Critical:** This must be created BEFORE AI Extraction Rules Library (1.6) because:
- Rules library design depends on prompt structure
- Cost constraints inform which patterns to prioritize
- Token limits affect rule library complexity
- Prompt templates inform rule matching logic

## **1.6 AI Extraction Rules Library** 📝

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Created by:** Claude  
**Depends on:**
→ Product Logic Specification (1.1)

**Note:** Module 2 & 3 workflows and AER specifications are now fully covered in PLS Sections C.2, C.3, and C.3.8. No separate documents (1.4, 1.5) required.

**This is the "rules engine" for the LLM. Defines:**

**1. Rule Library Structure & Format:**
- Exact JSON schema for each rule pattern (pattern_id, pattern_version, pattern_regex, pattern_semantic, module, regulator, obligation_category, default_frequency, evidence_types, is_subjective, confidence_boost, source_documents, added_date, last_validated, usage_count, success_rate, false_positive_count, false_negative_count, is_active)
- Pattern matching methodology (regex, semantic, hybrid approach)
- Pattern match scoring algorithm (how ≥90% threshold is calculated)
- Rule versioning system (how rules are versioned and tracked)
- Rule metadata (source document, added date, last validated, usage count, success rate, false positive/negative counts)
- Database schema for rule storage (rule_library_patterns table structure with all fields)

**2. Pattern Matching Algorithm:**
- How pattern matching works (regex first? semantic first? hybrid?)
- Step-by-step matching workflow:
  1. For each document segment: Try regex pattern matching (fast, exact)
  2. If regex match ≥90%, use library rule
  3. If regex match 70-89%, try semantic matching
  4. If semantic match ≥90%, use library rule
  5. If all matches <90%, pass to LLM
- How match score is calculated (0-100%)
- Why ≥90% threshold (not 85%, not 95%) - justification
- What happens when multiple patterns match (highest score wins? user chooses?)
- How to handle partial matches (e.g., 75% match - use LLM or flag for review?)
- Calculate confidence boost: Library match gets +15% confidence, LLM extraction gets no boost
- Log pattern usage: Record which pattern matched, match score, if user confirmed/edited/rejected

**3. Pattern Categories by Module:**

**Module 1 Patterns:**
- EA permit patterns (standard conditions, monitoring frequencies, reporting requirements)
- EA standard conditions (numbered conditions, e.g., "Condition 2.3.1")
- SEPA permit variations
- NRW permit variations
- Improvement conditions (deadline-based)
- Subjective wording detection ("as appropriate", "where necessary", "reasonable measures") - 12 "always flag" phrases + 4 context-dependent
- Frequency detection patterns (annual, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily)
- Deadline detection patterns (explicit dates, relative dates)
- Obligation categorization (Monitoring, Reporting, Record-Keeping, Operational, Maintenance)

**Module 2 Patterns:**
- Water company consent patterns (Thames Water, Severn Trent, etc.)
- Parameter limit extraction (BOD, COD, pH, temperature, SS, FOG, Ammonia, Phosphorus)
- Sampling frequency patterns (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Exceedance threshold patterns (80% warning, 100% breach)
- Discharge volume patterns

**Module 3 Patterns:**
- MCPD registration patterns
- Generator type identification (MCPD_1_5MW, MCPD_5_50MW, Specified, Emergency)
- Run-hour limit extraction (annual, monthly)
- Stack test frequency patterns
- Maintenance requirement patterns

**AER Patterns:**
- Annual return structure recognition
- Emissions calculation patterns
- Fuel consumption tracking patterns

**4. Learning & Improvement Mechanism (CRITICAL - Technical Moat):**

**A. Pattern Discovery Process:**
- How new patterns are identified from user corrections
- How patterns are extracted from human-reviewed extractions
- How patterns are validated before adding to library
- Who approves new patterns (manual review process)

**B. Feedback Loop System:**
- How user corrections feed back into rule library
- How to track: "User edited extraction X → pattern Y was used → pattern Y needs refinement"
- How to identify patterns that fail frequently (low success_rate)
- How to deprecate/remove bad patterns

**C. Rule Refinement Process:**
- How existing rules are improved based on feedback
- How rule versions are incremented (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2)
- How to test rule changes before deployment
- How to rollback bad rule updates

**D. Accuracy Tracking:**
- How to measure rule library accuracy over time
- How to track: pattern match rate, LLM fallback rate, user correction rate
- How to identify which patterns need improvement
- How to set accuracy targets (e.g., 85% target, 90% for library matches)

**E. Database Learning Mechanism:**
- How `extraction_logs` data is analyzed to find patterns
- How user corrections in `review_queue_items` inform rule updates
- How `obligations.original_extraction` vs `obligations` (edited) differences create new rules
- How to query: "What patterns failed most often this month?"
- How to identify patterns that need improvement (low success_rate, high false_positive_count)

**5. Rule Library Versioning:**
- How rules are versioned (semantic versioning: major.minor.patch)
- When to increment major/minor/patch versions
- How `rule_library_version` is stored in `extraction_logs`
- How to track which extractions used which rule version
- How to rollback to previous rule version if accuracy drops

**6. Confidence Scoring Integration:**
- How rule library matches affect confidence scores
- Confidence boost for library matches (+15%? +10%?) - define exact boost amount
- How to combine pattern match score with LLM confidence
- How confidence thresholds apply to library matches vs LLM extractions
- Example calculations: Library match (95% pattern + 15% boost = 100% capped) vs LLM extraction (82% base, no boost)

**7. Hallucination Prevention Rules:**
- How rule library helps prevent hallucinations (grounding in known patterns)
- How to detect when LLM extraction doesn't match any known pattern (novel = higher hallucination risk)
- How pattern matching validates LLM output
- Rules for when to trust library match vs LLM extraction

**8. Error Handling & Edge Cases:**
- What happens when no pattern matches (LLM fallback)
- What happens when pattern matches but user rejects (pattern needs refinement)
- What happens when pattern matches but confidence is borderline (70-89%)
- How to handle novel condition types (never seen before)
- How to handle ambiguous patterns (could match multiple rules)
- Low-confidence extraction thresholds
- When humans must confirm (subjective obligations, edge cases)

**9. Pattern Maintenance Process:**
- Who maintains the rule library (internal team? users?)
- How often rules are reviewed/updated (weekly? monthly?)
- How to prioritize which patterns to improve first (by failure rate? by usage?)
- How to test rule changes before deployment
- How to measure impact of rule updates (accuracy before/after)
- How rule updates are deployed (hot reload? restart required?)

**10. Database Schema for Rule Library:**
- Should rules be stored in database? (yes, for versioning and tracking)
- Table structure for rules (rule_library_patterns table with all fields: id, pattern_id, pattern_version, pattern_regex, pattern_semantic, applicability (JSONB with module_types array, regulators array, document_types array), obligation_category, default_frequency, evidence_types, is_subjective, confidence_boost, source_documents, added_date, last_validated, usage_count, success_rate, false_positive_count, false_negative_count, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
- How rules are loaded into memory for fast matching
- How rule updates are deployed (hot reload? restart required?)
- Analytics queries for rule usage and effectiveness

**11. Integration Points:**
- How rules feed into LLM prompts (context for extraction)
- How rules affect confidence scores (boost calculation)
- How rules prevent hallucinations (pattern validation)
- How extraction_logs inform rules (learning queries)
- How review_queue_items inform rules (user correction feedback)

**Document Structure:**
1. Introduction (purpose, how it fits into extraction pipeline, versioning overview)
2. Rule Library Structure (JSON schema, pattern format, rule versioning system)
3. Pattern Matching Algorithm (regex matching, semantic matching, hybrid approach, match scoring methodology, threshold logic ≥90%)
4. Pattern Categories by Module (Module 1, 2, 3, AER patterns - all listed)
5. Learning & Improvement Mechanism (CRITICAL - technical moat: Pattern Discovery, Feedback Loop, Rule Refinement, Accuracy Tracking, Database Learning)
6. Rule Library Versioning (semantic versioning: major.minor.patch, when to increment, rollback procedures)
7. Confidence Scoring Integration (how library matches boost confidence, combine with LLM confidence, threshold application)
8. Hallucination Prevention Rules (how patterns validate LLM output, detect novel patterns, trust rules)
9. Error Handling & Edge Cases (no match, user rejection, borderline confidence, novel conditions, ambiguous patterns)
10. Pattern Maintenance Process (who maintains, update frequency, prioritization, testing, deployment, impact measurement)
11. Database Schema (rule_library_patterns table structure, loading into memory, deployment)
12. Integration Points (how rules connect to LLM prompts, confidence scores, hallucination prevention, extraction_logs)

**F. Consultant Data Boundary:**

**Consultant Isolation Policy Pattern (applied to all tables with company_id or site_id):**
```sql
-- Example: Consultant isolation for companies table
CREATE POLICY companies_consultant_isolation ON companies
FOR ALL
USING (
  CASE
    WHEN EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role = 'consultant'
    )
    THEN
      id IN (
        SELECT company_id FROM user_roles
        WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
        AND role = 'consultant'
      )
    ELSE TRUE
  END
);
```

**Note:** Consultant isolation must be combined with role-based policies (e.g., consultant can only READ, not CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE for most entities)

**3. Complete CRUD Matrix for ALL 28 Entities:**

**CRUD Matrix per Role per Entity (C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, D=Delete, -=No Access):**

| Entity | Owner | Admin | Staff | Viewer | Consultant |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| **Companies** | CRUD | CRU | R | R | R (client only) |

*Module 2/3 entities require module activation (check `module_activations` table)

**Special Rules:**
- **Evidence Deletion:** No role can DELETE evidence items (system archives only after retention period)
- **Deadline Creation:** Deadlines are auto-generated by system (no manual INSERT)
- **Exceedance Creation:** Exceedances are auto-generated by system (no manual INSERT)
- **Escalation Creation:** Escalations are auto-generated by system (no manual INSERT)

- **Notifications:** Users can only access their own notifications
- **Excel Imports:** Users can only access their own imports
- **Consultant Restrictions:** Consultants can only access assigned client companies/sites (enforced via RLS)

**4. Permission Evaluation Logic:**

**4.1 Permission Check Function (Exact SQL Implementation):**

```sql
-- Function to check if user has company access
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION has_company_access(user_id UUID, company_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_roles.user_id = has_company_access.user_id
    AND user_roles.company_id = has_company_access.company_id
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Function to check if user has site access
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION has_site_access(user_id UUID, site_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_site_assignments
    WHERE user_site_assignments.user_id = has_site_access.user_id
    AND user_site_assignments.site_id = has_site_access.site_id
  )
  OR EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM sites s
    INNER JOIN user_roles ur ON s.company_id = ur.company_id
    WHERE s.id = has_site_access.site_id
    AND ur.user_id = has_site_access.user_id
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Function to check if user has role permission for operation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION role_has_permission(
  user_id UUID,
  entity_type TEXT,
  operation TEXT
)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE
  user_role TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Get user's role for the entity's company
  SELECT role INTO user_role
  FROM user_roles
  WHERE user_roles.user_id = role_has_permission.user_id
  LIMIT 1;
  
  -- Check permission based on role and operation
  CASE user_role
    WHEN 'owner' THEN
      RETURN TRUE; -- Owner has all permissions
    WHEN 'admin' THEN
      RETURN operation != 'DELETE' OR entity_type IN ('companies', 'users'); -- Admin can delete most, but not companies/users
    WHEN 'staff' THEN
      RETURN operation IN ('CREATE', 'READ', 'UPDATE') AND entity_type NOT IN ('users', 'user_roles', 'module_activations');
    WHEN 'viewer' THEN
      RETURN operation = 'READ'; -- Viewer is read-only
    WHEN 'consultant' THEN
      RETURN operation IN ('CREATE', 'READ', 'UPDATE') AND entity_type IN ('documents', 'obligations', 'evidence_items', 'audit_packs');
    ELSE
      RETURN FALSE;
  END CASE;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Function to check module activation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_module_activated(
  company_id UUID,
  module_id UUID
)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM module_activations
    WHERE module_activations.company_id = is_module_activated.company_id
    AND module_activations.module_id = is_module_activated.module_id
    AND module_activations.is_active = TRUE
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**4.2 Permission Check Pseudocode (Application Layer):**

```
function checkPermission(userId, resource, operation):
  // Get user roles
  roles = getUserRoles(userId)
  
  // Check company-level access
  if not hasCompanyAccess(userId, resource.company_id):
    return false
  
  // Check consultant isolation (if consultant role)
  if roles.includes('consultant'):
    if not isConsultantAssignedToCompany(userId, resource.company_id):
      return false
  
  // Check site-level access (if resource has site_id)
  if resource.site_id and not hasSiteAccess(userId, resource.site_id):
    return false
  
  // Check module activation (for Module 2/3 entities)
  if resource.module_id:
    if not isModuleActivated(resource.company_id, resource.module_id):
      return false
  
  // Check role-based permissions
  for role in roles:
    if roleHasPermission(role, resource.type, operation):
      return true
  
  return false

function hasCompanyAccess(userId, companyId):
  return exists(
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = userId
    AND company_id = companyId
  )

function hasSiteAccess(userId, siteId):
  return exists(
    SELECT 1 FROM user_site_assignments
    WHERE user_id = userId
    AND site_id = siteId
  )
  OR exists(
    SELECT 1 FROM sites s
    INNER JOIN user_roles ur ON s.company_id = ur.company_id
    WHERE s.id = siteId
    AND ur.user_id = userId
  )

function isConsultantAssignedToCompany(consultantId, companyId):
  return exists(
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = consultantId
    AND company_id = companyId
    AND role = 'consultant'
  )

function isModuleActivated(companyId, moduleId):
  return exists(
    SELECT 1 FROM module_activations
    WHERE company_id = companyId
    AND module_id = moduleId
    AND is_active = TRUE
  )
```

**6. Consultant Data Boundary Rules (see PLS Section B.10.2.3):**

**Cross-Client Data Isolation:**
- Consultants can only access companies assigned to them
- Assignment tracked in `consultant_client_assignments` table
- RLS policies enforce isolation at database level
- API layer validates consultant access before queries

**Consultant Access Logic:**
```
function checkConsultantAccess(consultantId, companyId):
  return exists(
    SELECT 1 FROM consultant_client_assignments
    WHERE consultant_id = consultantId
    AND company_id = companyId
  )
```

**7. Multi-Site Permissions:**

**Cross-Site Access Rules:**
- Users can access multiple sites (within their company)
- Site access determined by `user_site_assignments` table
- RLS policies check site access for site-scoped resources
- Consolidated views aggregate data across accessible sites

**8. Module Permissions:**

**Module Activation Permissions:**
- Only Owner and Admin can activate modules
- Activation checked via `user_roles` table (role = 'owner' or 'admin')
- Prerequisites checked via `modules.requires_module_id` (see PLS Section C.4)

**Module Data Access:**
- Module data follows same RLS rules as other data
- Module activation grants access to module-specific screens
- Module deactivation restricts access to module screens

**10. RLS Policy Deployment:**

**10.1 Migration Strategy:**

**Migration File Structure:**
```
migrations/
├── 001_enable_rls_on_tables.sql
├── 002_create_rls_policies_core.sql
├── 003_create_rls_policies_module2.sql
├── 004_create_rls_policies_module3.sql
├── 005_create_rls_policies_cross_module.sql
├── 006_create_permission_functions.sql
└── 007_create_rls_indexes.sql
```

**Migration Steps:**
1. Enable RLS on all tables: `ALTER TABLE {table} ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
2. Create RLS policies for each table (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
3. Create permission check functions
4. Create indexes for RLS policy performance
5. Test policies in staging environment
6. Deploy to production

**10.2 Policy Versioning:**

**Version Tracking:**
- Track policy changes in `policy_versions` table
- Include policy name, version, SQL, created_at, created_by
- Rollback to previous version if needed

**10.3 Policy Rollback Procedures:**

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Identify problematic policy
2. Disable policy: `DROP POLICY {policy_name} ON {table};`
3. Restore previous version from `policy_versions` table
4. Re-create policy from previous version
5. Test rollback in staging
6. Deploy rollback to production

**10.4 Policy Testing:**

**Unit Tests:**
- Test each RLS policy individually
- Test with different user roles
- Test with different data scenarios

**Integration Tests:**
- Test RLS policies with API endpoints
- Test RLS policies with background jobs
- Test RLS policies with real-time subscriptions

**Performance Tests:**
- Measure RLS overhead (query time with/without RLS)
- Test with large datasets (10,000+ rows)
- Test with complex joins
- Benchmark: RLS should add < 50ms overhead per query

**11. Service Role vs User JWT Handling:**

**11.1 Service Role Usage:**

**When to Use Service Role:**
- Background jobs (document processing, Excel import, monitoring schedules)
- Admin operations (system maintenance, bulk operations)
- Cross-tenant operations (if needed)
- Migration scripts

**Service Role Bypass:**
- Service role JWT bypasses RLS policies
- Use `auth.role() = 'service_role'` check in policies
- Service role should still respect business logic constraints

**11.2 User JWT Usage:**

**When to Use User JWT:**
- User-facing API requests
- Real-time subscriptions
- User-initiated operations
- Onboarding flows

**User JWT RLS Enforcement:**
- All RLS policies apply to user JWT
- Policies check `auth.uid()` for user identity
- Policies check `user_roles` and `user_site_assignments` for access

**12. Edge Cases and Special Scenarios:**

**12.1 Soft Delete Handling:**

**RLS Policy Pattern for Soft Deletes:**
```sql
-- Add deleted_at check to all SELECT policies
CREATE POLICY {table}_select_{scope} ON {table}
FOR SELECT
USING (
  deleted_at IS NULL
  AND (
    -- Existing access conditions
  )
);
```

**Who Can See Soft-Deleted Records:**
- Only Owner/Admin can see soft-deleted records (for restore purposes)
- Add separate policy: `{table}_select_deleted_owner_admin`

**Who Can Restore:**
- Only Owner/Admin can restore soft-deleted records
- UPDATE policy: `{table}_update_deleted_owner_admin` (sets `deleted_at = NULL`)

**Who Can Permanently Delete:**
- Only Owner can permanently delete (hard delete)
- Requires separate DELETE policy with `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` check

**12.2 Nested Resource Access:**

**Access via Parent Resource:**
- Obligations accessed via documents: Check `document.site_id` in obligation policy
- Evidence accessed via obligations: Check `obligation.site_id` in evidence policy
- Schedules accessed via obligations: Check `obligation.site_id` in schedule policy

**RLS Policy Pattern:**
```sql
-- Obligations accessible via document relationship
CREATE POLICY obligations_select_via_document ON obligations
FOR SELECT
USING (
  document_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM documents
    WHERE site_id IN (
      SELECT site_id FROM user_site_assignments
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  )
);
```

**12.3 Module-Specific Permissions:**

**Module Activation Check:**
- Add module activation check to Module 2/3 table policies
- Pattern: `AND is_module_activated(company_id, module_id)`

**RLS Policy Pattern:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY parameters_select_site_module ON parameters
FOR SELECT
USING (
  site_id IN (
    SELECT site_id FROM user_site_assignments
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  )
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM module_activations
    WHERE company_id = parameters.company_id
    AND module_id = parameters.module_id
    AND is_active = TRUE
  )
);
```

**12.4 Time-Based Permissions:**

**Historical Data Access:**
- No time restrictions on historical data
- Users can access all historical records (within site/company access)

**Future-Dated Records:**
- No restrictions on future-dated records
- Users can create obligations with future deadlines

**12.5 Bulk Operations:**

**Bulk Create:**
- Same RLS policies apply to bulk INSERT
- Each row checked individually against RLS policies
- Partial success: Some rows succeed, some fail (based on RLS)

**Bulk Update:**
- Same RLS policies apply to bulk UPDATE
- Each row checked individually against RLS policies

**Bulk Delete:**
- Same RLS policies apply to bulk DELETE
- Each row checked individually against RLS policies

**13. Performance Considerations:**

**13.1 Index Requirements:**

**Required Indexes for RLS Performance:**
```sql
-- Indexes for user_roles lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_user_id_company_id ON user_roles(user_id, company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_user_id_role ON user_roles(user_id, role);

-- Indexes for user_site_assignments lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_site_assignments_user_id_site_id ON user_site_assignments(user_id, site_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_site_assignments_user_id_role ON user_site_assignments(user_id, role);

-- Indexes for module_activations lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_module_activations_company_id_module_id ON module_activations(company_id, module_id) WHERE is_active = TRUE;

-- Indexes for company_id and site_id on all tables
CREATE INDEX idx_{table}_company_id ON {table}(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_{table}_site_id ON {table}(site_id);
```

**13.2 Query Optimization:**

**RLS Policy Optimization:**
- Use EXISTS subqueries (faster than IN subqueries)
- Use indexed columns in policy conditions
- Avoid complex joins in policy conditions
- Cache permission checks where possible

**13.3 Caching Strategy:**

**Permission Check Caching:**
- Cache company access checks (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Cache site access checks (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Cache role checks (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Invalidate cache on role/site assignment changes

**14. TypeScript Interfaces:**

**14.1 Permission Check Interfaces:**

```typescript
interface PermissionCheckRequest {
  resource_type: string;
  resource_id: string;
  operation: 'CREATE' | 'READ' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
}

interface PermissionCheckResponse {
  has_permission: boolean;
  reason?: string;
  role?: string;
  company_access: boolean;
  site_access: boolean;
  module_activated?: boolean;
}

interface RolePermission {
  role: 'owner' | 'admin' | 'staff' | 'viewer' | 'consultant';
  entity_type: string;
  operations: ('CREATE' | 'READ' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE')[];
}
```

**14.2 RLS Policy Configuration Interface:**

```typescript
interface RLSPolicyConfig {
  table_name: string;
  operation: 'SELECT' | 'INSERT' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  policy_name: string;
  using_clause: string;
  with_check_clause?: string;
  roles?: string[];
}
```

## **2.10 AI Integration Layer** 📝

**Status:** ⏳ To be generated  
**Created by:** Cursor  
**Depends on:**
→ AI Microservice Prompts (1.7)
→ AI Layer Design & Cost Optimization (1.5a)
→ AI Extraction Rules Library (1.6) — *CRITICAL: Uses rules library to validate extractions*
→ Backend API (2.5)

**Document Format:**
- Markdown format with clear sections and subsections
- Include TypeScript interfaces for API wrapper functions
- Include code examples for OpenAI API integration
- Include error handling implementations
- Include cost tracking implementations
- Include integration with Background Jobs (Document Processing Job)
- Be specific and detailed—this is the AI integration implementation blueprint
- Target: 8,000-10,000 words (comprehensive AI integration)

**What Cursor Must Create:**

This document defines the complete AI integration layer. It must include:

**1. API Key Management:**

**A. API Key Storage:**

**Environment Variables:**
- Primary key: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required)
- Fallback keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY_FALLBACK_1`, `OPENAI_API_KEY_FALLBACK_2` (optional)
- Key validation: Test key validity on application startup
- Key rotation: Support multiple keys for seamless rotation

**API Key Storage Implementation:**
```typescript
interface APIKeyConfig {
  primary: string;
  fallbacks: string[];
  currentKey: string;
  rotationEnabled: boolean;
}

class APIKeyManager {
  private config: APIKeyConfig;
  
  async validateKey(key: string): Promise<boolean> {
    // Test key validity by making a test API call
  }
  
  async rotateKey(): Promise<void> {
    // Rotate to next fallback key
  }
  
  getCurrentKey(): string {
    return this.config.currentKey;
  }
}
```

**B. API Key Usage:**

**Primary Key Strategy:**
- Default key: Use primary key for all requests
- Failover logic: Automatically switch to fallback keys if primary fails
- Key rotation: Rotate keys periodically (every 90 days)
- Key validation: Validate keys on startup and periodically

**Key Rotation Implementation:**
```typescript
async function rotateAPIKey(): Promise<void> {
  // 1. Generate new key in OpenAI dashboard
  // 2. Update environment variable (fallback key)
  // 3. Test new key validity
  // 4. Switch to new key
  // 5. Keep old key as fallback for 7 days
  // 6. Remove old key after 7 days
}
```

**C. Key Validation:**

**Validation Strategy:**
- Startup validation: Test all keys on application startup
- Periodic validation: Validate keys every 24 hours
- Failure handling: Alert admins if all keys invalid
- Validation endpoint: Test key with minimal API call

**Validation Implementation:**
```typescript
async function validateAPIKey(key: string): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/models', {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${key}` }
    });
    return response.ok;
  } catch (error) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**2. Request Formatting:**

**A. OpenAI API Request Structure:**

**Model Selection:**
- Primary model: GPT-4.1 (for high-accuracy extractions)
- Fallback model: GPT-4.1 Mini (for cost optimization, fallback scenarios)
- Model selection logic: Use GPT-4.1 for complex documents, GPT-4.1 Mini for simple documents
- Model fallback: Automatically fallback to GPT-4.1 Mini if GPT-4.1 fails

**Request Format:**
- System message: Load from prompt template (see Section 4)
- User message: Load from prompt template, substitute variables
- JSON schema: Enforce structured JSON output
- Temperature: 0.2 (low temperature for consistent outputs)
- Max tokens: 4000 (for obligation extraction), 2000 (for parameter extraction)

**Request Formatting Code:**
```typescript
interface OpenAIRequest {
  model: 'gpt-4o' | 'gpt-4o-mini';
  messages: Array<{
    role: 'system' | 'user';
    content: string;
  }>;
  response_format: { type: 'json_object' };
  temperature: number;
  max_tokens: number;
  top_p?: number;
  frequency_penalty?: number;
  presence_penalty?: number;
}

interface RequestConfig {
  model: 'gpt-4o' | 'gpt-4o-mini';
  temperature: number;
  maxTokens: number;
  systemMessage: string;
  userMessage: string;
  jsonSchema?: object;
}

async function formatOpenAIRequest(
  config: RequestConfig,
  documentContent: string
): Promise<OpenAIRequest> {
  return {
    model: config.model,
    messages: [
      { role: 'system', content: config.systemMessage },
      { role: 'user', content: config.userMessage.replace('{{document}}', documentContent) }
    ],
    response_format: { type: 'json_object' },
    temperature: config.temperature,
    max_tokens: config.maxTokens
  };
}
```

**B. Token Optimization:**

**Prompt Compression:**
- Remove unnecessary whitespace: Compress prompts before sending
- Minimize context: Only include relevant document sections
- Optimize JSON schema: Use concise schema definitions
- Token counting: Count tokens before sending (enforce limits)

**Token Optimization Implementation:**
```typescript
function compressPrompt(prompt: string): string {
  // Remove extra whitespace
  // Remove comments
  // Optimize structure
  return prompt.replace(/\s+/g, ' ').trim();
}

function countTokens(text: string): number {
  // Use tiktoken or similar library
  // Approximate: 1 token ≈ 4 characters
  return Math.ceil(text.length / 4);
}
```

**C. Request Batching:**

**Batching Strategy:**
- Batch size: Up to 5 documents per batch (respect token limits)
- Batch processing: Process multiple documents in single API call
- Batch error handling: Handle partial batch failures gracefully
- Batch optimization: Group similar documents together

**Batching Implementation:**
```typescript
interface BatchRequest {
  documents: Array<{ id: string; content: string }>;
  maxBatchSize: number;
  maxTokensPerBatch: number;
}

async function batchProcessDocuments(
  batch: BatchRequest
): Promise<Array<{ documentId: string; result: any }>> {
  // Group documents into batches
  // Process each batch
  // Handle partial failures
  // Return results
}
```

**3. Cost Optimization Implementation:**

**A. Token Management:**

**Token Counting:**
- Input tokens: Count tokens in system message + user message
- Output tokens: Count tokens in LLM response
- Token limits: Enforce 1M token context limit (GPT-4.1), 128K (GPT-4.1 Mini)
- Token tracking: Track token usage per request, per document, per module

**Token Counting Implementation:**
```typescript
interface TokenUsage {
  inputTokens: number;
  outputTokens: number;
  totalTokens: number;
  model: string;
  estimatedCost: number;
}

class TokenCounter {
  async countTokens(text: string, model: string): Promise<number> {
    // Use tiktoken library for accurate token counting
    // Model-specific tokenizers
  }
  
  calculateCost(usage: TokenUsage): number {
    // Calculate cost based on model pricing
    // GPT-4.1: $0.03/1K input tokens, $0.06/1K output tokens
    // GPT-4.1 Mini: $0.001/1K input tokens, $0.002/1K output tokens
  }
}
```

**Token Limits Enforcement:**
- Pre-request validation: Check token count before API call
- Truncation strategy: Truncate document content if exceeds limit
- Error handling: Return error if document too large
- Optimization: Compress prompts to fit within limits

**B. Batching Strategy:**

**Batch Size Limits:**
- Maximum batch size: 5 documents per batch
- Token limit per batch: 800K tokens (leave margin for 1M limit)
- Batch optimization: Group documents by size/complexity
- Batch error handling: Handle partial batch failures

**Batching Implementation:**
```typescript
interface BatchConfig {
  maxDocuments: number;
  maxTokensPerBatch: number;
  batchTimeout: number; // milliseconds
}

class DocumentBatcher {
  async createBatches(
    documents: Document[],
    config: BatchConfig
  ): Promise<Document[][]> {
    // Group documents into batches
    // Respect token limits
    // Optimize batch composition
  }
  
  async processBatch(batch: Document[]): Promise<BatchResult> {
    // Process batch
    // Handle errors
    // Return results
  }
}
```

**Batch Error Handling:**
- Partial failures: Continue processing successful documents
- Retry logic: Retry failed documents individually
- Error reporting: Report which documents failed and why
- Recovery: Allow manual retry of failed documents

**C. Caching Strategy:**

**Cache Rule Library Matches:**
- Cache key: Document hash + rule pattern hash
- Cache threshold: ≥90% match = cache result
- Cache TTL: 30 days (or until rule library updated)
- Cache invalidation: Invalidate on rule library updates

**Cache Identical Segments:**
- Segment identification: Identify identical document segments
- Cache key: Segment hash
- Cache result: LLM extraction result for segment
- Cache reuse: Reuse cached results for identical segments

**Cache Implementation:**
```typescript
interface CacheEntry {
  key: string;
  value: any;
  ttl: number;
  createdAt: Date;
}

class ExtractionCache {
  async get(key: string): Promise<any | null> {
    // Check cache
    // Validate TTL
    // Return cached value or null
  }
  
  async set(key: string, value: any, ttl: number): Promise<void> {
    // Store in cache
    // Set TTL
  }
  
  async invalidate(pattern: string): Promise<void> {
    // Invalidate cache entries matching pattern
  }
}
```

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Rule library updates: Invalidate all rule-related caches
- Manual invalidation: Allow admins to invalidate cache
- TTL expiration: Automatic expiration based on TTL
- Cache monitoring: Monitor cache hit rates

**4. Prompt Template Integration:**

**A. Prompt Template Loading:**

**Template Source:**
- Load from: AI Microservice Prompts (Document 1.7)
- Template storage: Store templates in database or file system
- Template versioning: Track prompt versions, support A/B testing
- Template validation: Validate template syntax on load

**Template Loading Implementation:**
```typescript
interface PromptTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  systemMessage: string;
  userMessage: string;
  jsonSchema: object;
  variables: string[];
}

class PromptTemplateLoader {
  async loadTemplate(templateId: string, version?: string): Promise<PromptTemplate> {
    // Load template from storage
    // Validate template
    // Return template object
  }
  
  async getLatestVersion(templateId: string): Promise<PromptTemplate> {
    // Get latest version of template
  }
}
```

**B. Template Variable Substitution:**

**Variable Substitution:**
- Variable format: `{{variable_name}}`
- Required variables: `{{document}}`, `{{site_id}}`, `{{document_type}}`
- Optional variables: `{{context}}`, `{{previous_extractions}}`
- Variable validation: Validate all required variables present

**Variable Substitution Implementation:**
```typescript
interface TemplateVariables {
  document?: string;
  siteId?: string;
  documentType?: string;
  context?: string;
  [key: string]: any;
}

function substituteVariables(
  template: string,
  variables: TemplateVariables
): string {
  return template.replace(/\{\{(\w+)\}\}/g, (match, key) => {
    if (variables[key] === undefined) {
      throw new Error(`Missing required variable: ${key}`);
    }
    return String(variables[key]);
  });
}
```

**C. Template Versioning:**

**Version Management:**
- Version format: Semantic versioning (e.g., "1.0.0")
- Version tracking: Track which version used for each extraction
- A/B testing: Support multiple versions for testing
- Version rollback: Rollback to previous version if issues

**Version Tracking Implementation:**
```typescript
interface TemplateVersion {
  templateId: string;
  version: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  isActive: boolean;
  usageCount: number;
}

async function trackTemplateUsage(
  templateId: string,
  version: string,
  extractionId: string
): Promise<void> {
  // Log template version usage
  // Update usage statistics
}
```

**D. Prompt Template Usage:**

**System Message:**
- Load from template: Load system message from prompt template
- Variable substitution: Substitute variables in system message
- Validation: Validate system message before use

**User Message:**
- Load from template: Load user message from prompt template
- Variable substitution: Substitute document content and other variables
- Context addition: Add relevant context (previous extractions, site info)

**JSON Schema:**
- Load from template: Load JSON schema from prompt template
- Schema validation: Validate schema structure
- Schema enforcement: Enforce schema in API request

**5. Confidence Scoring:**

**A. Confidence Score Interpretation:**

**LLM Confidence Scores:**
- Extract from response: LLM provides confidence scores in JSON response
- Score range: 0-100 (percentage)
- Score interpretation: Higher score = more confident extraction
- Score validation: Validate confidence scores are within range

**Confidence Score Structure:**
```typescript
interface ConfidenceScore {
  score: number; // 0-100
  source: 'llm' | 'rule_library' | 'combined';
  factors: {
    llmConfidence?: number;
    ruleMatch?: boolean;
    patternMatch?: number;
  };
}

interface ExtractionResult {
  obligation: Obligation;
  confidence: ConfidenceScore;
  flagged: boolean;
  reviewRequired: boolean;
}
```

**B. Confidence Thresholds:**

**Threshold Configuration:**
- Auto-extract threshold: >85% = auto-extract, no review needed
- Review threshold: <85% = flag for human review
- Critical threshold: <70% = high priority review
- Subjective threshold: Always flag subjective obligations (see PLS Section A.6)

**Threshold Application:**
```typescript
function applyConfidenceThreshold(
  confidence: ConfidenceScore,
  isSubjective: boolean
): { autoExtract: boolean; reviewRequired: boolean } {
  if (isSubjective) {
    return { autoExtract: false, reviewRequired: true };
  }
  
  if (confidence.score > 85) {
    return { autoExtract: true, reviewRequired: false };
  }
  
  return { autoExtract: false, reviewRequired: true };
}
```

**C. Confidence Boost:**

**Rule Library Boost:**
- Library match boost: +15% confidence boost for rule library matches
- Pattern match boost: +10% confidence boost for pattern matches (≥90% match)
- Combined scoring: Combine LLM confidence + rule library boost
- Boost calculation: `final_confidence = min(100, llm_confidence + boost)`

**Confidence Boost Implementation:**
```typescript
function applyConfidenceBoost(
  llmConfidence: number,
  hasRuleMatch: boolean,
  patternMatchScore?: number
): number {
  let boosted = llmConfidence;
  
  if (hasRuleMatch) {
    boosted += 15; // Rule library match boost
  }
  
  if (patternMatchScore && patternMatchScore >= 0.9) {
    boosted += 10; // Pattern match boost
  }
  
  return Math.min(100, boosted);
}
```

**D. Confidence Score Application:**

**Threshold Comparison:**
- Compare scores: Compare confidence scores to thresholds
- Auto-extract: Automatically extract high-confidence items
- Flag for review: Flag low-confidence items for human review
- Log scores: Store confidence scores in extraction_logs table

**Confidence Logging:**
```typescript
async function logConfidenceScore(
  extractionLogId: string,
  confidence: ConfidenceScore,
  decision: 'auto_extract' | 'flagged_for_review'
): Promise<void> {
  await updateExtractionLog(extractionLogId, {
    confidence_score: confidence.score,
    confidence_source: confidence.source,
    extraction_decision: decision
  });
}
```

**6. Rules Library Integration:**

**A. Rule Library Lookup:**

**Pattern Matching Strategy:**
- Regex First, Then Semantic:**
- Step 1: Try regex patterns first (fastest, most accurate)
- Step 2: If no regex match, try semantic matching (slower, more flexible)
- Step 3: If no match, proceed with LLM extraction
- Match threshold: ≥90% match = use library rule

**Pattern Matching Implementation:**
```typescript
interface RuleMatch {
  ruleId: string;
  patternId: string;
  matchScore: number;
  matchType: 'regex' | 'semantic';
  extractedData: any;
}

class RuleLibraryMatcher {
  async findMatches(
    documentContent: string,
    documentType: string
  ): Promise<RuleMatch[]> {
    // 1. Try regex patterns
    const regexMatches = await this.tryRegexPatterns(documentContent, documentType);
    if (regexMatches.length > 0) {
      return regexMatches;
    }
    
    // 2. Try semantic matching
    const semanticMatches = await this.trySemanticMatching(documentContent, documentType);
    return semanticMatches.filter(m => m.matchScore >= 0.9);
  }
  
  private async tryRegexPatterns(content: string, type: string): Promise<RuleMatch[]> {
    // Load regex patterns for document type
    // Apply patterns
    // Return matches with scores
  }
  
  private async trySemanticMatching(content: string, type: string): Promise<RuleMatch[]> {
    // Use embedding similarity
    // Calculate match scores
    // Return matches
  }
}
```

**B. Match Threshold:**

**Threshold Application:**
- High confidence: ≥90% match = use library rule, skip LLM
- Medium confidence: 70-89% match = use library rule + LLM validation
- Low confidence: <70% match = use LLM extraction only
- Threshold configuration: Configurable per rule pattern

**C. Rule Library Application:**

**Validate Extractions:**
- Compare output: Compare LLM output to library patterns
- Validation logic: Check if LLM output matches known patterns
- Apply rules: Use library rules when match found
- Fallback: Use LLM extraction if no library match

**Rule Application Implementation:**
```typescript
async function applyRuleLibrary(
  documentContent: string,
  documentType: string,
  llmOutput: any
): Promise<{ useLibrary: boolean; ruleMatch?: RuleMatch; llmOutput?: any }> {
  // 1. Try rule library first
  const matches = await ruleLibraryMatcher.findMatches(documentContent, documentType);
  
  if (matches.length > 0 && matches[0].matchScore >= 0.9) {
    return {
      useLibrary: true,
      ruleMatch: matches[0]
    };
  }
  
  // 2. Validate LLM output against library patterns
  const llmValidation = await validateLLMOutput(llmOutput, documentType);
  
  if (llmValidation.matchScore >= 0.9) {
    return {
      useLibrary: true,
      ruleMatch: llmValidation
    };
  }
  
  // 3. Use LLM output
  return {
    useLibrary: false,
    llmOutput
  };
}
```

**D. Rule Usage Logging:**

**Usage Tracking:**
- Track patterns: Log which patterns matched
- Track frequency: Track how often each pattern used
- Track accuracy: Track accuracy of rule-based extractions
- Analytics: Generate analytics on rule library effectiveness

**Usage Logging Implementation:**
```typescript
async function logRuleUsage(
  ruleId: string,
  patternId: string,
  matchScore: number,
  extractionId: string
): Promise<void> {
  await db.insert('rule_usage_logs', {
    rule_id: ruleId,
    pattern_id: patternId,
    match_score: matchScore,
    extraction_id: extractionId,
    used_at: new Date()
  });
}
```

**7. Low-Confidence Item Flagging:**

**A. Flagging Logic:**

**Confidence-Based Flagging:**
- Low confidence: Confidence <85% = flag for human review
- Critical flagging: Confidence <70% = high priority review
- Subjective obligations: Always flag (see PLS Section A.6)
- Novel patterns: Flag if no library match and confidence <90%

**Flagging Criteria:**
```typescript
interface FlaggingCriteria {
  confidenceThreshold: number;
  isSubjective: boolean;
  hasRuleMatch: boolean;
  isNovelPattern: boolean;
}

function shouldFlagItem(
  confidence: number,
  criteria: FlaggingCriteria
): boolean {
  // Always flag subjective obligations
  if (criteria.isSubjective) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Flag low confidence
  if (confidence < criteria.confidenceThreshold) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Flag novel patterns without rule match
  if (criteria.isNovelPattern && !criteria.hasRuleMatch && confidence < 90) {
    return true;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

**B. Flagging Implementation:**

**Review Queue Creation:**
- Create review items: Insert flagged items into `review_queue_items` table
- Priority assignment: Assign priority based on confidence score
- Metadata storage: Store extraction metadata for review
- Status tracking: Track review status (pending, reviewed, approved, rejected)

**Review Queue Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ReviewQueueItem {
  id: string;
  extractionId: string;
  documentId: string;
  obligationId?: string;
  confidenceScore: number;
  flagReason: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  status: 'pending' | 'reviewed' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  createdAt: Date;
  reviewedAt?: Date;
  reviewedBy?: string;
}

async function createReviewQueueItem(
  extraction: ExtractionResult,
  flagReason: string
): Promise<ReviewQueueItem> {
  const priority = extraction.confidence.score < 70 ? 'high' : 
                   extraction.confidence.score < 85 ? 'medium' : 'low';
  
  return await db.insert('review_queue_items', {
    extraction_id: extraction.id,
    document_id: extraction.documentId,
    confidence_score: extraction.confidence.score,
    flag_reason: flagReason,
    priority,
    status: 'pending'
  });
}
```

**C. Notification System:**

**User Notifications:**
- Notification creation: Create notification for flagged items
- Notification type: "Review Required" notification
- Notification delivery: Email + in-app notification
- Notification content: Include obligation details, confidence score, flag reason

**Notification Implementation:**
```typescript
async function notifyReviewRequired(
  userId: string,
  reviewItem: ReviewQueueItem
): Promise<void> {
  await createNotification({
    userId,
    type: 'REVIEW_REQUIRED',
    title: 'Obligation Review Required',
    message: `An obligation requires review (Confidence: ${reviewItem.confidenceScore}%)`,
    actionUrl: `/review/${reviewItem.id}`,
    priority: reviewItem.priority
  });
}
```

**D. Review Workflow:**

**Review Process:**
- User review: Users review flagged items in review queue
- Actions: Approve, reject, or edit extraction
- Status update: Update review queue item status
- Obligation creation: Create obligation if approved
- Feedback loop: Use review feedback to improve extraction accuracy

**8. Data Transformation:**

**A. LLM Output to Database Format:**

**Transformation Strategy:**
- Map obligations: Transform LLM output to obligations table schema
- Map parameters: Transform LLM output to parameters table schema (Module 2)
- Map run-hours: Transform LLM output to run_hour_records table schema (Module 3)
- Validate data: Validate transformed data before insertion
- Apply business rules: Apply business logic during transformation

**Transformation Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface LLMObligationOutput {
  obligations: Array<{
    title: string;
    frequency: string;
    deadline_date?: string;
    description?: string;
    is_subjective?: boolean;
    confidence?: number;
  }>;
}

interface LLMParameterOutput {
  parameters: Array<{
    name: string;
    current_value: number;
    limit: number;
    unit: string;
  }>;
}

interface LLMRunHourOutput {
  generators: Array<{
    generator_name: string;
    run_hours: number;
    date: string;
  }>;
}
```

**B. Obligation Transformation:**

**Obligation Mapping:**
- Title mapping: Map `title` to `obligation_title`
- Frequency mapping: Map `frequency` to `frequency` enum

**Obligation Transformation Implementation:**
```typescript
function transformLLMOutputToObligations(
  llmOutput: LLMObligationOutput,
  documentId: string,
  siteId: string,
  importSource: 'PDF_EXTRACTION' | 'EXCEL_IMPORT' | 'MANUAL'
): Obligation[] {
  return llmOutput.obligations.map((obligation, index) => {
    // Validate required fields
    if (!obligation.title || !obligation.frequency) {
      throw new Error(`Missing required fields in obligation ${index}`);
    }
    
    // Parse deadline date
    let deadlineDate: Date | null = null;
    if (obligation.deadline_date) {
      deadlineDate = new Date(obligation.deadline_date);
      if (isNaN(deadlineDate.getTime())) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid deadline date: ${obligation.deadline_date}`);
      }
    }
    
    // Map to database schema
    return {
      id: generateUUID(),
      document_id: documentId,
      site_id: siteId,
      obligation_title: obligation.title,
      frequency: mapFrequency(obligation.frequency),
      deadline_date: deadlineDate,
      description: obligation.description || null,
      is_subjective: obligation.is_subjective || false,
      import_source: importSource,
      created_at: new Date(),
      updated_at: new Date()
    };
  });
}

function mapFrequency(frequency: string): Frequency {
  // Map frequency string to enum
  const frequencyMap: Record<string, Frequency> = {
    'annual': 'ANNUAL',
    'monthly': 'MONTHLY',
    'quarterly': 'QUARTERLY',
    'weekly': 'WEEKLY',
    'daily': 'DAILY'
  };
  
  return frequencyMap[frequency.toLowerCase()] || 'ANNUAL';
}
```

**C. Parameter Transformation (Module 2):**

**Parameter Mapping:**
- Name mapping: Map `name` to `parameter_name`
- Value mapping: Map `current_value` to `current_value` (numeric)
- Limit mapping: Map `limit` to `limit_value` (numeric)
- Unit mapping: Map `unit` to `unit`

**Parameter Transformation Implementation:**
```typescript
function transformLLMOutputToParameters(
  llmOutput: LLMParameterOutput,
  siteId: string
): Parameter[] {
  return llmOutput.parameters.map((param) => {
    // Validate numeric values
    if (isNaN(param.current_value) || isNaN(param.limit)) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid numeric values for parameter: ${param.name}`);
    }
    
    return {
      id: generateUUID(),
      site_id: siteId,
      parameter_name: param.name,
      current_value: param.current_value,
      limit_value: param.limit,
      unit: param.unit,
      created_at: new Date(),
      updated_at: new Date()
    };
  });
}
```

**D. Run Hour Transformation (Module 3):**

**Run Hour Mapping:**
- Generator mapping: Map `generator_name` to `generator_id` (lookup)
- Hours mapping: Map `run_hours` to `hours` (numeric)
- Date mapping: Parse `date` to Date object

**Run Hour Transformation Implementation:**
```typescript
async function transformLLMOutputToRunHours(
  llmOutput: LLMRunHourOutput,
  siteId: string
): Promise<RunHourRecord[]> {
  const records: RunHourRecord[] = [];
  
  for (const generatorData of llmOutput.generators) {
    // Lookup generator by name
    const generator = await findGeneratorByName(siteId, generatorData.generator_name);
    if (!generator) {
      throw new Error(`Generator not found: ${generatorData.generator_name}`);
    }
    
    // Validate hours
    if (isNaN(generatorData.run_hours)) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid run hours for generator: ${generatorData.generator_name}`);
    }
    
    // Parse date
    const recordDate = new Date(generatorData.date);
    if (isNaN(recordDate.getTime())) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid date: ${generatorData.date}`);
    }
    
    records.push({
      id: generateUUID(),
      generator_id: generator.id,
      site_id: siteId,
      hours: generatorData.run_hours,
      record_date: recordDate,
      created_at: new Date(),
      updated_at: new Date()
    });
  }
  
  return records;
}
```

**E. Data Validation:**

**Validation Rules:**
- Required fields: Validate all required fields present
- Data types: Validate data types (dates, numbers, enums)
- Business rules: Apply business logic validation
- Constraints: Validate against database constraints

**Validation Implementation:**
```typescript
function validateObligation(obligation: Obligation): ValidationResult {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  // Required fields
  if (!obligation.obligation_title) {
    errors.push('obligation_title is required');
  }
  if (!obligation.frequency) {
    errors.push('frequency is required');
  }
  
  // Date validation
  if (obligation.deadline_date && isNaN(obligation.deadline_date.getTime())) {
    errors.push('deadline_date must be a valid date');
  }
  
  // Frequency enum validation
  const validFrequencies = ['ANNUAL', 'MONTHLY', 'QUARTERLY', 'WEEKLY', 'DAILY'];
  if (!validFrequencies.includes(obligation.frequency)) {
    errors.push(`frequency must be one of: ${validFrequencies.join(', ')}`);
  }
  
  return {
    isValid: errors.length === 0,
    errors
  };
}
```

**9. Error Handling:**

**A. Error Types:**

**API Errors:**
- Rate limit errors: 429 status code (rate limit exceeded)
- Invalid key errors: 401 status code (invalid API key)
- Quota exceeded: 429 status code (quota exceeded)
- Model unavailable: 503 status code (model temporarily unavailable)
- Server errors: 500+ status codes (OpenAI server errors)

**Timeout Errors:**
- Request timeout: Request exceeds 30 seconds
- Connection timeout: Connection cannot be established
- Read timeout: Response reading timeout

**Parsing Errors:**
- Invalid JSON: LLM returns invalid JSON
- Schema mismatch: JSON doesn't match expected schema
- Missing fields: Required fields missing from JSON

**Validation Errors:**
- Data type errors: Invalid data types (dates, numbers)
- Business rule violations: Data violates business rules
- Constraint violations: Data violates database constraints

**Error Type Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface APIError {
  type: 'rate_limit' | 'invalid_key' | 'quota_exceeded' | 'server_error';
  statusCode: number;
  message: string;
  retryAfter?: number; // seconds
}

interface TimeoutError {
  type: 'request_timeout' | 'connection_timeout' | 'read_timeout';
  timeout: number; // milliseconds
  message: string;
}

interface ParsingError {
  type: 'invalid_json' | 'schema_mismatch' | 'missing_fields';
  message: string;
  details?: any;
}

interface ValidationError {
  type: 'data_type_error' | 'business_rule_violation' | 'constraint_violation';
  field: string;
  message: string;
  value?: any;
}
```

**B. Error Handling Implementation:**

**Retry Logic:**
- Retry strategy: Exponential backoff (2 retries, 2s, 4s delays)
- Retry conditions: Retry on transient errors (rate limit, timeout, server errors)
- No retry: Don't retry on permanent errors (invalid key, validation errors)
- Max retries: Maximum 2 retries per request

**Retry Implementation:**
```typescript
interface RetryConfig {
  maxRetries: number;
  initialDelay: number; // milliseconds
  backoffMultiplier: number;
  retryableErrors: string[];
}

async function retryWithBackoff<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  config: RetryConfig
): Promise<T> {
  let lastError: Error;
  
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= config.maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      lastError = error;
      
      // Check if error is retryable
      if (!isRetryableError(error, config.retryableErrors)) {
        throw error;
      }
      
      // Don't retry on last attempt
      if (attempt === config.maxRetries) {
        throw error;
      }
      
      // Calculate delay
      const delay = config.initialDelay * Math.pow(config.backoffMultiplier, attempt);
      await sleep(delay);
    }
  }
  
  throw lastError!;
}

function isRetryableError(error: any, retryableErrors: string[]): boolean {
  if (error instanceof APIError) {
    return retryableErrors.includes(error.type);
  }
  return false;
}
```

**C. Fallback Strategy:**

**Model Fallback:**
- Primary model: Use GPT-4.1 for all requests
- Fallback model: Use GPT-4.1 Mini if GPT-4.1 fails
- Fallback conditions: Fallback on rate limit, quota exceeded, model unavailable
- Fallback logging: Log fallback usage for cost tracking

**Fallback Implementation:**
```typescript
async function callOpenAIWithFallback(
  request: OpenAIRequest
): Promise<OpenAIResponse> {
  try {
    // Try primary model
    return await callOpenAI(request);
  } catch (error) {
    if (shouldFallback(error)) {
      // Fallback to GPT-4.1 Mini
      const fallbackRequest = {
        ...request,
        model: 'gpt-4o-mini' as const
      };
      
      await logFallbackUsage(request.model, 'gpt-4o-mini', error);
      return await callOpenAI(fallbackRequest);
    }
    throw error;
  }
}

function shouldFallback(error: any): boolean {
  if (error instanceof APIError) {
    return ['rate_limit', 'quota_exceeded', 'server_error'].includes(error.type);
  }
  return false;
}
```

**D. Error Logging:**

**Error Logging:**
- Log to extraction_logs: Log all errors to extraction_logs table
- Error details: Store error type, message, stack trace
- Context: Store request context (document ID, model, tokens)
- Error aggregation: Aggregate errors for analytics

**Error Logging Implementation:**
```typescript
async function logExtractionError(
  extractionLogId: string,
  error: Error,
  context: {
    documentId: string;
    model: string;
    requestTokens: number;
  }
): Promise<void> {
  await updateExtractionLog(extractionLogId, {
    status: 'FAILED',
    error_message: error.message,
    error_type: error.constructor.name,
    error_stack: error.stack,
    error_context: context
  });
}
```

**E. Error Notifications:**

**Admin Notifications:**
- Critical errors: Notify admins of critical errors (invalid key, quota exceeded)
- Error threshold: Notify if error rate exceeds threshold
- Error summary: Send daily error summary to admins
- Alert escalation: Escalate if errors persist

**Error Notification Implementation:**
```typescript
async function notifyAdminOfError(
  error: Error,
  context: any
): Promise<void> {
  if (isCriticalError(error)) {
    await createNotification({
      userId: 'admin',
      type: 'CRITICAL_ERROR',
      title: 'Critical AI Integration Error',
      message: `Error: ${error.message}`,
      priority: 'high',
      metadata: context
    });
  }
}

function isCriticalError(error: any): boolean {
  if (error instanceof APIError) {
    return ['invalid_key', 'quota_exceeded'].includes(error.type);
  }
  return false;
}
```

**10. Rate Limiting:**

**A. Rate Limit Detection:**

**Rate Limit Detection:**
- Status code: Detect 429 status code (rate limit exceeded)
- Response headers: Parse rate limit headers (`x-ratelimit-*`)
- Error message: Parse rate limit error messages
- Retry-After header: Extract retry delay from `Retry-After` header

**Rate Limit Detection Implementation:**
```typescript
interface RateLimitInfo {
  limit: number;
  remaining: number;
  resetTime: Date;
  retryAfter?: number; // seconds
}

function detectRateLimit(response: Response): RateLimitInfo | null {
  if (response.status !== 429) {
    return null;
  }
  
  const headers = response.headers;
  const limit = parseInt(headers.get('x-ratelimit-limit') || '0');
  const remaining = parseInt(headers.get('x-ratelimit-remaining') || '0');
  const resetTime = new Date(parseInt(headers.get('x-ratelimit-reset') || '0') * 1000);
  const retryAfter = parseInt(headers.get('retry-after') || '0');
  
  return {
    limit,
    remaining,
    resetTime,
    retryAfter: retryAfter > 0 ? retryAfter : undefined
  };
}
```

**B. Rate Limit Handling:**

**Request Queuing:**
- Queue requests: Queue requests when rate limited
- Queue priority: Maintain priority queue (critical requests first)
- Queue processing: Process queue when rate limit resets
- Queue monitoring: Monitor queue size and wait times

**Request Queue Implementation:**
```typescript
interface QueuedRequest {
  id: string;
  request: OpenAIRequest;
  priority: number;
  queuedAt: Date;
  retryAfter?: Date;
}

class RateLimitQueue {
  private queue: QueuedRequest[] = [];
  
  async enqueue(request: OpenAIRequest, priority: number = 0): Promise<string> {
    const queuedRequest: QueuedRequest = {
      id: generateUUID(),
      request,
      priority,
      queuedAt: new Date()
    };
    
    this.queue.push(queuedRequest);
    this.queue.sort((a, b) => b.priority - a.priority);
    
    return queuedRequest.id;
  }
  
  async processQueue(): Promise<void> {
    while (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const request = this.queue.shift()!;
      
      // Check if we can process (rate limit reset)
      if (await canProcessRequest()) {
        await executeRequest(request);
      } else {
        // Re-queue if still rate limited
        this.queue.unshift(request);
        await sleep(1000); // Wait 1 second
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**C. Exponential Backoff:**

**Backoff Strategy:**
- Initial delay: Start with 2 seconds delay
- Backoff multiplier: Multiply delay by 2 for each retry
- Max delay: Cap delay at 60 seconds
- Jitter: Add random jitter to prevent thundering herd

**Backoff Implementation:**
```typescript
function calculateBackoffDelay(attempt: number, retryAfter?: number): number {
  if (retryAfter) {
    return retryAfter * 1000; // Use Retry-After header value
  }
  
  const baseDelay = 2000; // 2 seconds
  const maxDelay = 60000; // 60 seconds
  const delay = Math.min(baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt), maxDelay);
  
  // Add jitter (±20%)
  const jitter = delay * 0.2 * (Math.random() * 2 - 1);
  return Math.floor(delay + jitter);
}
```

**D. Rate Limit Monitoring:**

**Usage Tracking:**
- Track limits: Track rate limit usage from response headers
- Track remaining: Monitor remaining requests
- Track reset time: Track when rate limit resets
- Alerting: Alert when approaching rate limit

**Rate Limit Monitoring Implementation:**
```typescript
class RateLimitMonitor {
  private currentLimit: RateLimitInfo | null = null;
  
  async updateLimitInfo(info: RateLimitInfo): Promise<void> {
    this.currentLimit = info;
    
    // Alert if approaching limit
    if (info.remaining < info.limit * 0.1) {
      await alertRateLimitApproaching(info);
    }
  }
  
  async canMakeRequest(): Promise<boolean> {
    if (!this.currentLimit) {
      return true;
    }
    
    return this.currentLimit.remaining > 0 && 
           new Date() >= this.currentLimit.resetTime;
  }
}
```

**11. Cost Tracking:**

**A. Token Counting:**

**Token Counting:**
- Input tokens: Count tokens in system message + user message
- Output tokens: Count tokens in LLM response
- Accurate counting: Use tiktoken library for accurate token counting
- Model-specific: Use model-specific tokenizers

**Token Counting Implementation:**
```typescript
import { encoding_for_model } from 'tiktoken';

interface TokenCount {
  inputTokens: number;
  outputTokens: number;
  totalTokens: number;
}

class TokenCounter {
  private encoders: Map<string, any> = new Map();
  
  async countTokens(text: string, model: string): Promise<number> {
    if (!this.encoders.has(model)) {
      this.encoders.set(model, encoding_for_model(model));
    }
    
    const encoder = this.encoders.get(model);
    return encoder.encode(text).length;
  }
  
  async countRequestTokens(
    request: OpenAIRequest,
    response: OpenAIResponse
  ): Promise<TokenCount> {
    const inputTokens = await this.countInputTokens(request);
    const outputTokens = await this.countOutputTokens(response);
    
    return {
      inputTokens,
      outputTokens,
      totalTokens: inputTokens + outputTokens
    };
  }
  
  private async countInputTokens(request: OpenAIRequest): Promise<number> {
    let total = 0;
    for (const message of request.messages) {
      total += await this.countTokens(message.content, request.model);
    }
    return total;
  }
  
  private async countOutputTokens(response: OpenAIResponse): Promise<number> {
    return await this.countTokens(response.choices[0].message.content, response.model);
  }
}
```

**B. Cost Calculation:**

**Pricing Model:**
- GPT-4.1 pricing: $0.03 per 1K input tokens, $0.06 per 1K output tokens
- GPT-4.1 Mini pricing: $0.001 per 1K input tokens, $0.002 per 1K output tokens
- Cost calculation: `cost = (inputTokens / 1000 * inputPrice) + (outputTokens / 1000 * outputPrice)`
- Cost rounding: Round to 4 decimal places

**Cost Calculation Implementation:**
```typescript
interface ModelPricing {
  inputPricePer1K: number;
  outputPricePer1K: number;
}

const PRICING: Record<string, ModelPricing> = {
  'gpt-4o': {
    inputPricePer1K: 0.03,
    outputPricePer1K: 0.06
  },
  'gpt-4o-mini': {
    inputPricePer1K: 0.001,
    outputPricePer1K: 0.002
  }
};

function calculateCost(
  inputTokens: number,
  outputTokens: number,
  model: string
): number {
  const pricing = PRICING[model];
  if (!pricing) {
    throw new Error(`Unknown model pricing: ${model}`);
  }
  
  const inputCost = (inputTokens / 1000) * pricing.inputPricePer1K;
  const outputCost = (outputTokens / 1000) * pricing.outputPricePer1K;
  const totalCost = inputCost + outputCost;
  
  return Math.round(totalCost * 10000) / 10000; // Round to 4 decimal places
}
```

**C. Cost Logging:**

**Logging to Database:**
- Log to extraction_logs: Log token counts and costs to extraction_logs table
- Fields: `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `estimated_cost`, `model`
- Timestamp: Log timestamp for cost analytics
- Aggregation: Enable cost aggregation queries

**Cost Logging Implementation:**
```typescript
async function trackCost(
  extractionLogId: string,
  tokenCount: TokenCount,
  model: string
): Promise<void> {
  const cost = calculateCost(tokenCount.inputTokens, tokenCount.outputTokens, model);
  
  await updateExtractionLog(extractionLogId, {
    input_tokens: tokenCount.inputTokens,
    output_tokens: tokenCount.outputTokens,
    total_tokens: tokenCount.totalTokens,
    estimated_cost: cost,
    model_used: model
  });
}
```

**D. Cost Analytics:**

**Cost Aggregation:**
- Per document: Aggregate costs per document
- Per module: Aggregate costs per module (Module 1, 2, 3)
- Per time period: Aggregate costs per day/week/month
- Per user/company: Aggregate costs per user/company

**Cost Analytics Implementation:**
```typescript
interface CostAnalytics {
  totalCost: number;
  totalTokens: number;
  averageCostPerDocument: number;
  costByModule: Record<string, number>;
  costByTimePeriod: Array<{ period: string; cost: number }>;
}

async function getCostAnalytics(
  filters: {
    startDate?: Date;
    endDate?: Date;
    companyId?: string;
    moduleId?: string;
  }
): Promise<CostAnalytics> {
  // Query extraction_logs table
  // Aggregate costs
  // Return analytics
}
```

**12. Background Job Integration:**

**Job Triggers:**
- Background job: Document Processing Job (from Background Jobs Spec 2.3) calls AI integration layer
- Job input: Document ID, site ID, user ID, extraction options
- Job status: Update job status (PENDING → RUNNING → COMPLETED/FAILED)
- Job progress: Update job progress during processing

**Job Integration Implementation:**

async function processDocument(jobInput: DocumentProcessingJobInput): Promise<void> {
  const { documentId, siteId, userId, extractionOptions } = jobInput;
  
  try {
    // Update job status to RUNNING
    await updateJobStatus(jobInput.jobId, 'RUNNING');
    
    // 1. Load document from storage
    const document = await loadDocument(documentId);
    
    // 2. Check rule library first (if enabled)
    let extractionResult: ExtractionResult | null = null;
    if (extractionOptions.useRuleLibrary) {
      const ruleMatches = await ruleLibraryMatcher.findMatches(document.content, document.type);
      if (ruleMatches.length > 0 && ruleMatches[0].matchScore >= 0.9) {
        extractionResult = await applyRuleLibraryMatch(ruleMatches[0], documentId, siteId);
      }
    }
    
    // 3. Call OpenAI API if no rule library match
    if (!extractionResult) {
      const llmOutput = await callOpenAIWithFallback(createRequest(document));
      extractionResult = await transformLLMOutput(llmOutput, documentId, siteId);
    }
    
    // 4. Apply confidence thresholds
    const flaggedItems = await applyConfidenceThresholds(extractionResult, extractionOptions);
    
    // 5. Store results in database
    await storeExtractionResults(extractionResult, flaggedItems);
    
    // 6. Update job status to COMPLETED
    await updateJobStatus(jobInput.jobId, 'COMPLETED', {
      obligationsCreated: extractionResult.obligations.length,
      flaggedForReview: flaggedItems.length
    });
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Update job status to FAILED
    await updateJobStatus(jobInput.jobId, 'FAILED', {
      error: error.message
    });
    
    // Log error
    await logExtractionError(documentId, error);
    
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**B. Job Status Updates:**

**Status Management:**

  jobId: string,
  status: 'PENDING' | 'RUNNING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'FAILED',
  metadata?: any
): Promise<void> {
  await db.update('background_jobs', {
    id: jobId,
    status,
    updated_at: new Date(),
    ...(metadata && { metadata })
  });
}

async function updateJobProgress(
  jobId: string,
  progress: number // 0-100
): Promise<void> {
  await db.update('background_jobs', {
    id: jobId,
    progress,
    updated_at: new Date()

- Store obligations: Store extracted obligations in obligations table
- Store parameters: Store extracted parameters in parameters table (Module 2)
- Store run hours: Store extracted run hours in run_hour_records table (Module 3)
- Link to document: Link extractions to source document

**Results Storage Implementation:**
```typescript
async function storeExtractionResults(
  result: ExtractionResult,
  flaggedItems: FlaggedItem[]
): Promise<void> {
  // Store obligations
  for (const obligation of result.obligations) {
    await db.insert('obligations', obligation);
  }
  
  // Store parameters (Module 2)
  if (result.parameters) {
    for (const parameter of result.parameters) {
      await db.insert('parameters', parameter);
    }
  }
  
  // Store run hours (Module 3)
  if (result.runHours) {
    for (const runHour of result.runHours) {
      await db.insert('run_hour_records', runHour);
    }
  }
  
  // Create review queue items for flagged items
  for (const item of flaggedItems) {
    await createReviewQueueItem(item);
  }
}
```

**D. Job Error Handling:**

- DLQ handling: Failed jobs sent to Dead-Letter Queue after max retries
- Error logging: Log errors to extraction_logs table
- Error notifications: Notify users/admins of job failures

**Error Handling Implementation:**
```typescript
async function handleJobError(

  console.log('Deploying to staging...');
  
  // Run tests
  execSync('npm run test', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  
  // Build
  execSync('npm run build', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  
  // Deploy to Vercel staging
  execSync('vercel --prod --env=staging', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  
  console.log('Staging deployment complete');
}

export async function deployToProduction(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('Deploying to production...');
  
  // Run tests
  execSync('npm run test', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  
  // Build
  execSync('npm run build', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  
  // Deploy to Vercel production
  execSync('vercel --prod', { stdio: 'inherit' });
  
  console.log('Production deployment complete');
}
```

  severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium';
}

function shouldRollback(errorRate: number, responseTime: number): RollbackDecision {
  if (errorRate > 0.1) { // >10% error rate
    return {
      shouldRollback: true,
      reason: 'High error rate detected',
      severity: 'critical'
    };
  }
  
  if (responseTime > 2000) { // >2s response time
    return {
      shouldRollback: true,
      reason: 'Performance degradation detected',
      severity: 'high'
    };
  }
  
  return {
    shouldRollback: false,
    reason: 'No issues detected',
    severity: 'medium'
  };
}
```

**B. Rollback Process:**

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Identify issue: Identify the issue causing problems
2. Decide to rollback: Make decision to rollback
3. Rollback application: Rollback application to previous version (Vercel rollback)
4. Rollback database migrations: Rollback database migrations if needed
5. Verify rollback: Verify rollback success
6. Investigate issue: Investigate root cause
7. Fix issue: Fix the issue
8. Re-deploy: Re-deploy after fix

**Rollback Implementation:**
```typescript
// scripts/rollback.ts
import { execSync } from 'child_process';

export async function rollbackApplication(): Promise<void> {
  console.log('Rolling back application...');
  
  // Get previous deployment
  const deployments = execSync('vercel ls', { encoding: 'utf-8' });
  const previousDeployment = parseDeployments(deployments)[1]; // Second most recent
  
  // Rollback to previous deployment
  execSync(`vercel rollback ${previousDeployment.id}`, { stdio: 'inherit' });
  
  console.log('Application rollback complete');
}

export async function rollbackDatabaseMigration(migrationName: string): Promise<void> {
  console.log(`Rolling back database migration: ${migrationName}`);
  
  // Run rollback migration
  execSync(`supabase migration rollback ${migrationName}`, { stdio: 'inherit' });
  
  console.log('Database migration rollback complete');
}
```

**C. Rollback Verification:**

**Verification Steps:**
- Application status: Verify application is running
- Error rate: Verify error rate is back to normal
- Performance: Verify performance is back to normal
- Data integrity: Verify data integrity

**Rollback Verification Implementation:**
```typescript
export async function verifyRollback(): Promise<boolean> {
  // Check application health
  const healthCheck = await fetch('https://app.epcompliance.com/api/health');
  if (!healthCheck.ok) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Check error rate
  const errorRate = await getErrorRate();
  if (errorRate > 0.05) { // >5% error rate
    return false;
  }
  
  // Check response time
  const responseTime = await getAverageResponseTime();
  if (responseTime > 1000) { // >1s response time
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
}
```
