## 1. CURRENT PRICING MODEL (SUMMARY)

EP Compliance uses a modular, site-based pricing structure optimised for UK SME budgets:

| Component | Price | Basis |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Module 1 — Environmental Permits | £149/month | Per site |
| Module 2 — Trade Effluent | £59/month | Per site (add-on) |
| Module 3 — MCPD/Generators | £79/month | Per company (add-on) |
| Additional Permit | £49/month | Per permit |
| Additional Site | £99/month | Per site |

**Current ARPU:** £174/month (Year 1) → £201/month (Year 2)

For full pricing rationale, expansion waterfall, and ROI calculations, see MCP Section 7 (Commercial Model).

## 2. ALTERNATIVE PRICING MODELS

### 2.1 Permit-Based Pricing

**Concept:** Price per permit uploaded rather than per site. Each permit incurs a monthly charge regardless of site structure.

| Permits | Monthly Price | Effective Cost/Permit |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 permit | £99 | £99 |
| 2-3 permits | £169 | £56-85 |
| 4-6 permits | £249 | £42-62 |
| 7+ permits | £329 | <£47 |

**Pros:**
- Direct value correlation — customers pay for what they use
- Scales naturally with complexity
- Simple to explain: "£99 per permit, volume discounts apply"

**Cons:**
- Unpredictable revenue — customer permit counts vary significantly
- Penalises complex sites (waste operators average 2.3 permits)
- Reduces expansion revenue from additional permits (currently £49/each)

**When it makes sense:** If customer feedback shows strong resistance to site-based pricing, or if ICP #3 (Small Manufacturers) proves to have simpler single-permit sites than expected.

**Migration considerations:** Would require grandfathering existing customers on current pricing. New pricing applies to new customers only. Risk: cannibalises £49/permit expansion revenue stream.

---

### 2.2 Site-Based Pricing Variations

**Concept:** Tiered site pricing based on complexity indicators (employee count, permit count, or inspection frequency).

| Tier | Criteria | Monthly Price |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Small Site | <50 employees, 1 permit | £99/month |
| Standard Site | 50-150 employees, 2-3 permits | £179/month |
| Complex Site | 150+ employees OR 4+ permits | £279/month |

**Pros:**
- Captures more value from high-complexity sites
- Lower entry point (£99) reduces friction for smaller prospects
- Aligns price with actual support/complexity burden

**Cons:**
- Requires site assessment before quoting (slows sales cycle)
- Customers may game criteria ("we only have 49 employees")
- Complex to communicate compared to flat £149/site

**When it makes sense:** If churn analysis shows small sites leave due to price, while complex sites consider us underpriced.

**Migration considerations:** Existing customers remain on current pricing. Introduce tiers for new customers only after 6+ months of churn/upgrade data validates tier boundaries.

---

### 2.3 Usage-Based Pricing

**Concept:** Base platform fee plus charges per document processed, evidence uploaded, or obligation tracked.

| Component | Price |
|-----------|-------|
| Platform access | £79/month |
| Per permit processed | £25/permit |
| Per obligation tracked | £0.50/obligation/month |
| Per evidence file linked | £0.10/file |

**Pros:**
- Low entry barrier (£79 base) attracts price-sensitive prospects
- Revenue scales with genuine platform usage
- Aligns incentives — customers pay for value delivered

**Cons:**
- Unpredictable monthly bills frustrate SME finance teams
- Customers may limit usage to control costs (defeats purpose)
- Complex billing infrastructure required
- Compliance customers need *all* obligations tracked — can't selectively skip

**When it makes sense:** Only if enterprise upmarket move requires consumption-based model to compete with Sphera/Intelex. Not appropriate for SME ICP.

**Migration considerations:** Not recommended for current ICP. If explored, usage-based would be a separate enterprise tier, not a replacement for SME pricing.

---

### 2.4 Bundled Pricing

**Concept:** All-inclusive packages that combine modules, sites, and permits into fixed-price tiers.

| Bundle | Includes | Monthly Price |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Starter | Module 1, 1 site, 2 permits | £179/month |
| Professional | Modules 1+2, 2 sites, 5 permits | £349/month |
| Enterprise | All modules, 5 sites, unlimited permits | £599/month |

**Pros:**
- Predictable pricing for customers
- Higher initial ACV — captures full platform value upfront
- Simplifies sales conversation ("which bundle fits?")
- Reduces module cross-sell friction (already included)

**Cons:**
- Eliminates expansion revenue waterfall (currently +33% to +192% growth)
- May overprice for single-site, single-permit customers
- Bundles include modules customers don't need
- Harder to compete on entry price (£179 vs £149)

**When it makes sense:** If cross-sell conversion proves difficult (customers resist adding modules), bundling removes friction. Also appropriate if sales cycle shows buyers want "all-in" pricing upfront.

**Migration considerations:** Introduce as alternative option alongside current pricing. Position bundles for customers wanting simplicity; keep modular pricing for price-sensitive buyers.

## 3. COMPETITIVE PRICING ANALYSIS

### Enterprise Software (Sphera, Intelex)

| Competitor | Typical Price | Our Advantage |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Sphera | £30k-100k/year | 94-97% cheaper |
| Intelex | £25k-80k/year | 93-96% cheaper |
| Enablon | £40k-120k/year | 95-98% cheaper |

**Positioning:** We occupy the "right-sized" price point for SMEs. Enterprise tools require £30k+ annual budgets and dedicated compliance teams. Our £1,788-4,800/year range serves the 47,000 SME sites that enterprise solutions ignore.

**Value proposition:** Same permit parsing, obligation tracking, and audit pack generation — without enterprise implementation timelines (6+ months) or dedicated headcount requirements.

---

### Compliance Consultants

| Service | Typical Cost | Our Comparison |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Annual retainer | £15k-25k/year | 85-93% savings |
| Day rate | £800-1,200/day | Replaces 8-12 days/year |
| Permit review | £2,500-5,000 | One-time vs ongoing |

**Positioning:** We don't replace consultants for strategy — we replace their documentation drudgery. Current waste operators spend £6,400/year on consultant time (8 days at £800). EP Compliance reduces this to 2 days (£1,600), saving £4,800/year while the platform costs £1,788/year.

**Value proposition:** Continuous compliance monitoring vs. point-in-time consultant reviews. Consultants visit quarterly; we track daily.

---

### Generic Tools (Monday, Asana, Notion)

| Tool | Price Point | Our Advantage |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Monday.com | £8-20/user/month | No permit intelligence |
| Asana | £10-25/user/month | No regulatory knowledge |
| Notion | £8-15/user/month | No evidence linking |

**Positioning:** Generic project tools require manual obligation entry, provide no extraction capability, and lack audit-ready export. Our premium (£149 vs £50-100 for generic tools) delivers permit-specific value: automatic extraction, regulatory pattern libraries, and inspector-ready outputs.

**Value proposition:** 60-second permit parsing vs. 15+ hours manual entry. Regulatory expertise built in vs. DIY compliance structure.

## 4. EXPANSION REVENUE SCENARIOS

### Module Cross-Sell Impact

| Scenario | Year 1 ARPU | Year 2 ARPU | Change |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Current baseline | £174 | £201 | +16% |
| Module 2 adoption +10pp | £174 | £215 | +24% |
| Module 3 adoption +10pp | £174 | £209 | +20% |
| Both modules +10pp | £174 | £223 | +28% |

**Key insight:** Each 10 percentage point increase in module cross-sell rates adds £8-14/month to ARPU. Module 2 has higher leverage due to ICP #2 (Food & Beverage) concentration.

---

### Additional Permit/Site Revenue

| Customer Type | Avg Permits | Avg Sites | Additional Revenue/Customer |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Waste operator | 2.3 | 1.3 | £63.70/month (+43%) |
| Food processor | 1.8 | 1.8 | £99.00/month (+66%) |
| Small manufacturer | 1.4 | 1.1 | £9.90/month (+7%) |

**Key insight:** Food processors drive highest expansion revenue due to multi-site operations. Waste operators deliver moderate expansion through additional permits. Small manufacturers are single-site/single-permit — limited expansion without module cross-sell.

---

### Revenue Waterfall by Customer Cohort

| Cohort Entry | Month 1 | Month 6 | Month 12 | Growth |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Module 1 only | £149 | £149 | £149 | 0% |
| +1 permit by M3 | £149 | £198 | £198 | +33% |
| +Module 2 by M6 | £149 | £257 | £257 | +73% |
| +1 site by M12 | £149 | £257 | £356 | +139% |

**Key insight:** Expansion revenue materialises in Month 3-6 window. Sales motion should include expansion prompt at 90-day check-in.

## 5. PRICING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### When to Consider Alternative Models

- **Permit-based pricing:** If >30% of prospects cite "I only have one permit, why pay site price?" in sales objections
- **Tiered site pricing:** If churn analysis shows <50 employee sites churning at 2x rate of larger sites
- **Usage-based pricing:** Only if pursuing enterprise upmarket; not appropriate for current SME ICP
- **Bundled pricing:** If cross-sell conversion rates remain below 20% after 12 months despite active sales effort

### Migration Path (If Changing Pricing)

1. Validate signal — minimum 20 data points (churn reasons, sales objections, or competitor losses)
2. Model impact — calculate revenue effect on existing customer base
3. Grandfather existing — all current customers remain on original pricing
4. Test with new cohort — introduce new pricing for new customers only
5. Measure 90 days — compare conversion rates, ARPU, and early churn signals
6. Decide: expand, iterate, or revert

### Testing Approach

Run A/B pricing tests on new prospect cohorts only. Never change pricing for existing customers mid-contract. Minimum test duration: 90 days. Minimum sample size: 30 customers per variant. Primary metrics: demo-to-close rate, Month 3 churn, and ARPU at Month 6.

### Risk Considerations

- **Price decrease risk:** Signals desperation, may devalue product perception
- **Price increase risk:** Current £149 hits "no board approval" threshold — increasing to £199+ may slow sales cycle
- **Model change risk:** Complexity confuses sales conversations; stick with simple model until data forces change
- **Grandfather risk:** Long-term customers on old pricing creates operational complexity

---

## 6. RECOMMENDATION

**Maintain current pricing model for 12+ months.** The modular site-based structure is:
- Simple to communicate
- Aligned with SME budget authority (£149 < £150 threshold)
- Validated by ICP willingness-to-pay research (£149-248 range)
- Structured for expansion revenue (+33% to +192% growth potential)

**Revisit this document when:**
- 50+ customers provide feedback on pricing structure
- Cross-sell rates fall below 15% despite active effort
- Churn analysis reveals price-related patterns
- Enterprise prospects request consumption-based pricing

**Do not change pricing based on:**
- Individual prospect objections
- Competitor pricing changes
- Assumptions about "what the market wants"

Data-driven pricing decisions only.
